I get that she may be venting; keeping a journal or writing down how we’re feeling in a given moment is a great exercise to process and keep our emotional compromise in check, but if this reaches social media, she ought to know what kinda feedback she’ll be receiving.

We often find ourselves being angry with something else as an excuse not to be angry with ourselves over things we're unhappy with. For me, I knew that I was being selfish and cruel to other people on some level. But rather than admit that to myself, I would blame other people for failing to act in such a way that they made up for the shortcomings I had. Maybe that's what's happening with you. Maybe it isn't. I think that you've already taken a very important step-- you've figured out what it is that you're unhappy with. You want to be able to let stuff slide and to not get so angry. But implementing that is rough-- I understand. I can't tell you what your plan has to be, unfortunately, because everyone is different, and what worked for myself or others may not work for you. But I think it's important for you to look at what you're displeased with and come up with a plan for addressing it. Maybe you'll find that you're just treating the symptoms. That's ok. It doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong. It means that you're getting closer to figuring out what you're upset over. That's really quite valuable, even though it's also frustrating to not be finished. Getting yourself to a place you're happy with isn't quick or easy or painless. And I think you know that. But it *is* worth it. I can promise you that.\\n\", \"Man I don't have any advice but I can identify. Was 8 months unemployed and living at home and sometimes I just get so agitated I don't know what to do. It's like I want to scream or jump out of my skin or something but I can't. When I'm like that I can be really unkind to people. Like you I don't know what the problem is exactly but I know there is one and like you I can kind of control it. I just tell myself it's a temporary state and I'll feel better tomorrow or another time. Going out with friends helps the most for me and exercise is OK. Quit tobacco about a year ago and have drank a lot in the past so maybe it has something to do with that too.\\n\", \"have them do the talking. if they ask you a question respond and then turn it around on them. seem engaged in what they're telling you.\\n\", \"The hospital is a safe place where you can't hurt yourself, but if you go in for suicidal ideation, you won't really be receiving one-on-one therapy. You could be in anywhere from 3 to 7 days, but there are longer term inpatient programs designed for borderline personality patients at some facilities that do involve therapy. The best way to go about it is to have your doctor call around at local facilities and find out if a bed is available at a place with a good reputation. But, if you can just find a therapist on short notice who has experience with your diagnosis, this would be the best option. Do you have close friends or family members you can stay with or who can visit with you in the meantime? The point of finding therapy asap or going to the hospital, whichever you end up doing, is to stay physically safe. If you can accomplish this without 24/7 medical supervision, it's cheaper and might prevent you from dealing with the trauma of being in the hospital (also, you won't miss as much school/work). P.S. Antidepressants tend to make me ultra suicidal. Perhaps you could get your doctor to offer some alternatives and find out if the problem isn't the dosage but maybe the type of medication. Antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are sometimes prescribed to BPD patients to manage symptoms. Also, there is a subreddit /r/BPD where you can vent or talk to people who are in DBT.

By yourself, maybe recognize your triggers - when it starts to build - and try different tactics to deal with the root cause of the anger, avoid the blow up and write down how they worked in a kind of journal. Example: 1/22/2014 got angry about becky taking my hat. googled tips for dealing with anger and did #3, sticking grapes up my nose. it helped. Sort of just documenting it to yourself so you can learn how you work.

We want people to understand, and comprehend; to have gone through what we have, or maybe be able to echo the same level of emotions (whether happy, sad, or angry). It's going to sound cliche as hell but you need to learn to befriend yourself. It's going to start with disconnecting and really listening to yourself instead of avoiding it (by watching shows, consuming substances, ingesting alcoholic beverages). There are a ton of ways people avoid themselves as people, and the biggest way I've found to face it is to simply embrace myself even when I am disappointed with the negative emotions and thoughts I have.

Perhaps it's not the right thing for your friend to necessarily attend an MBT group, but it could be helpful for her to read about the therapy and to try and apply it in her day to day life. Inevitably, if someone is 'acting out', it will distance them from others. The only thing you can do as a friend is to stick around and be there for her. You can't control the actions of others as much as anyone else. I don't think this is selfish but it is probably due to a lack of insight into your friend's position. It seems clear to me that she's unable to overcome her issues alone, the worst thing that can happen for her at this point is for her support network to break down. This will only compound her current issues. So, in summary, try to help your friend directly by trying to get her to think about her own emotional state and her triggers and maybe you can work together to figure out some small solutions. Indirectly, you can help her by educating those around her and making sure that her support network knows how valuable each and every one of them are to her, even if she doesn't realise it. To change the way a person sees themselves, the world around them and their behaviour takes a very long time and a lot of hard work, these problems won't fix themselves over night. However, with the right care and support you should be able to help.\\n\", \"Daaaw that's so great. I'd be awesome actually.

One of the first people to add me after I\\'d reopened it (a girl, which made me feel even worse) upon looking at my profile commented how \"boring\" I seemed cause there was nothing on there. I ended up spending a bit of time setting up my profile (privacy settings, a decent picture, where I\\'m going to school etc.) and for a little while there I kinda checked it constantly. This, as you can imagine, really wasn\\'t the best move and decreased my self-esteem even more cause of my lacking social life. Needless to say, I tried my best to get out of that habit and instead tend to check in every week or so, since I\\'ve met a couple of people who would occasionally invite me to social events.

A real bunch of boring, slightly jerkish average guys. I tried to figure out why I didn't just go hang out with that other crowd. and i realised it come down to self worth. I didn't think myself worthy of hanging with that group. Instead il hang with these jerks that I don't care about, because even if our friendship fails, it's not like I lost anything valuable right? I don't have to deal with any anxiety with these guys because they are on my level, the level I deserve. Anyway, that's my thinking about what can cause this: Ones self worth can come into play.

I had friends in HS but I never hung out with them. I pretty much went to school, came home, went to work, and then slept. That was my sophmore-senior year. Senior year I became really good friends with my coworkers and we are still good friends now. I never went to prom or any silly dances. Sure I felt a little mad at myself at the time for not going, but I couldn't care less now. If you really want to not be an outsider, you need to change what you're doing. Going to school and not talking to anyone is not going to get you anywhere. Seriously talk to some people, eventually you'll become friends. I think you should get a job that requires you to talk to people and do that. That'll help you out way more than any friends from high school will, and to me it forces you to fix the problem.

Project programming, tool programming, IT, bugfix, databases management, ...? Depending on what your tasks are, your involvement with other people vary. I'm a software engineering student currently doing and internship in a big name company. I'm mostly doi g programming on the main project to further that peoject, and I also work a lot with another department of peogrammers specialized in datamining on the user's interacrions with our project. I implement stuff that sends data to their databases. I also do bugfixing like every other programmer in my department. My point is, I was scared shitless to do interviews, and when I entered the company for my first 2 weeks. I had no prior programming job experience, so this was pretty much like stepping on the unknown. And I adapted. It is scary at first, because you don't know anybody, you don't know what you're doing, you don't know if you're doing your job properly or if you are closing tasks fast enough. I know that for the first 2 months, I was scared that I wasn't doing a good enough job. My main contact throughout the first month was my internship supervisor, who was the lead for my team of programmers. I would report to him, I would get my tasks from him, and I would go to him for help. He introduced me to other people from various departments sometimes because they had the info I needed. He helped me fit in. He helped me know who to go to when I needed help from a specific department. After a month, I was pretty much ok with asking other people directly for help. I even started talking a lot more to the collegues that were sitting on the desks around me. After two months, I had and internship meeting with my school evaluator and my supervisor. And I learn that I was doing a great job, and that I adapted to and learned the project better than most interns they had in the past. However, he said that I was reluctant to go directly to other people for help and that I needed to broaden my circle of contacts. So overall, I wasn't doing so bad at all. I'm saying all this because I was in your shoes. Scared of interactions, scared of judgement from co-workers. And overall, I discovered that its not that bad. Its harder at first simply because you don't know anyone and you have to learn the project, and you feel like you don't know what your doing or that you're not doing it good enough. Truth is, you're an intern. You're not expected to know everything. You're not expected to adapt as fast as someone who has been in the industry for years. As for relationship, everything will come in time. If you're scared of talking to other people and need help with your tasks, go to your supervisor or your lead. Talk to him. He'll guide you to whom you need to talk to. He's there to help you. He'll introduce you to the right people. Good luck! I hope you enjoy yourself!\\n\", \"Good for you!

As for your mom I would say go one of two routes or both, first being have her sit in with your therapist or whoever you\\'re seeing and have him explain things to her. Option two wait it out. One of the most frustraiting things with mental illness is that time sometimes does alot of healling but its hard to see it happen. And as for your mom it might take a while for her to get older and mature to realize just how much her behavour effected you and your sister. At the same time you might want to move out when you can, if you\\'re going to college thats good but if not than you should try and maybe find some sort of community living or a roomate whos a good influence because you dont need to let your addiction control you. One thing thats important to know is that envermental factors such as your mother have a strong effect on how bad your symtoms become, like a dimmer swich the more you turn it the brighter the light same thing applies to stress factors. But as for \"getting over it\" and shit like that dont listen you can help urself but thats only when others can help give you power, and sometimes meds. You have a limited control of this and you cant force yourself to stop feeling depressed no matter who you are. Also if you every find that you\\'re mom or anyone you\\'re talking to about this is giving you advice using their experiance stop them and just try and tell them you just need.someone to listen to you cause doing that can actually hurt just as much as them not being there. Lastly (sorry for the long rant) but try and change your thinking, such as if you\\'re ever harsh on yourself start talking to yourself like you would someone else. Would you tell them all the hurtful things you tell yourself? Its also ok to help yourself and be there for you, idk if that makes sense but I visualize me consoling my younger self and just being there, and tell myself its ok to grieve over whatever is hurting me and just trying to help me. Little things like that can make a big difference, but most importantly many people suffer from mental illness so you are not alone, and whenever it gets bad try and keep fighting, it may be bad sometimes, but if you keep going and seeking help you will win, you just need to keep trying to help you and if you dont believe me I understand but you just gotta keep going and one day you\\'ll wake up and things will be a bit clearer.

With that said, imagine these thoughts as being contained within \\'floating boxes\\' in your mind, and let them pass along like the flow of water or the direction of the wind.

Here are a few key things that might give you some insight... (1) Anger is a secondary emotion. So if you're feeling anger there is another emotion that came before it and is responsible for the level of anger you feel. (2) Anger can feel like it's coming out of nowhere because so much of the anger process happens in our subconscious. Some research says we live our lives on auto-pilot up to 70% of the time on average. That's a lot of time for a lot to happen. (3) Mindfulness and awareness work could help you figure out what your triggers are and notice them before you're at the point of rage. You can get control. But controlling anger when it's intense is virtually futile. (4) Finally, the simplest reason behind anger is that we don't express the underlying issue. We often suppress it. We're so good at suppressing it, we can spiral into intense anger without even knowing there is something else to express. BUT if/when we express the underlying needs, anger can be an unnecessary step.\", \"You are none of those things.

No one thinks those things about you.

The conflicting thoughts and feelings about all this make it all impossible most of the time.

Ironic, seeing as I recently injured my knee for seemingly no reason at all. It just ‘went’...maybe because the muscles need work!!! I saw a really shitty workout on TV a couple of years back with a Z list celeb who I didn’t think much of, and thought “well if they can do it, so can I”, so I tried alongside them. They did things like jumping jacks etc in groups - count down from 40, take a tiny break. Count down from 30, take a tiny break. Then 20, and then try really hard for the last 10. For some reason, it gave me hope of completing just a simple physical task like that and I felt a (albeit very small) sense of achievement when I reached the end. Counting seems to help me. Maybe because it’s because you KNOW there’s an end, it’s very soon..and it gives you more control. Whereas with workout videos that go on for 30+mins, I always find it overwhelming.

You made some bad decisions based on amped up testosterone. We've all been there. Moving shit sucks and sometimes tempers flare. Losing your cool and getting to the point of physically lashing out is something that you need to address in order to start living better. Head butting someone - friend or not - is an extremely aggressive act and needs to be addressed. Your frustration over moving things and not getting the answer you wanted (regarding your request for help) caused a serious amount of aggression and you assaulted another person. I'd begin by writing things down immediately. How you feel is important. Angry, frustrated, ashamed... it's okay. You're human. We do some dumb things from time to time (including head-butting friends). The thing is, writing out how you feel will allow you to start to understand more why things escalated to assault. You need to ask yourself a number of hard questions and you need to figure yourself out. Why did you get so upset? Who are you more angry at; him or yourself? If you can get a grip on yourself now, you can begin to make amends. Lashing out at others is not the way to solve any problem - real or perceived. Just remember that help is available and we all need support (men far more often than not feel shame and low for thinking they could use support, but it is this that keeps us from realizing our true potential).

It sounds like you're alright without friends, but at the same time, you've never truly experienced what having a close friend is like in the first place.

If you happen to come across someone who shares some interests with you, and you enjoy being around them, then make an attempt at becoming friends with them by texting them and asking them to hang out or do that common interest some more.

When you start feeling better about yourself (you'll know when it happens, you feel light as a feather and existence seems like bliss compared to the saggy shitty feeling you normally have), you can tone down the exercise to a few times a week. The point is consistency. Cardio exercise is the best advice I can give as it doesn't require you to talk to anyone, so no real potential for embarrassment.

Another thing I\\'ve learned over time is that resisting pain really ends up causing more. I always remember this one time when I stubbed my toe, I tried embracing the pain and it washed over me very quickly. The more I acknowledged the pain, the faster it went away. Brach also talks about the \"trance of unworthiness\" which is a term that resonated with me. Since you mentioned self-doubt, I\\'d highly recommend taking a look at this book. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions or if there\\'s anything you\\'re wondering about. And if there\\'s anyone you feel you can reach out to, I\\'d recommend that as well.

YES I ditched him. I did it because he never made me feel like someone worthy. I was friends with him because i couldn't make any others. I assume you might have had simillar experiences from these guys before. I am terribly sorry they had to tell you that in your face, but you deserve better. just like they think they're better off without you, you're way better off without them. Now you will find the strength to learn to love yourself more and not give away your happiness. They have not right to make you feel this way so don't give them the privilege.

You met someone you admired greatly in many domains. Uncharacteristically, you made an effort to be closer to her in order to observe her better, to \"see how social people do this\". You express little to no interest in developing more of a personal relationship with her, especially since you felt \"no real connection there\", so you\\'ve ruled out that these feelings are based on a desire for a interpersonal connection with her. However, I can say that this sort of feeling is similar to something I\\'ve experienced. Funny thing is, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard of anyone else describe/analyze/understand this feeling in the same terms as I have. It\\'s like a crush or falling in love. But it\\'s not. The difference is, you don\\'t necessarily have that comfortable cool connection with the other person. Where you talk easily and share hobbies in this awesome way. But you do admire that other person greatly and aspire to be more like them. And may crave their validation and respect. Certainly their company, so you can learn from them. Here\\'s where me might diverge. ... If you\\'re like me, then you\\'d have this strong desire to express to them the impression they\\'ve made on you and what that\\'s meant. Also, you\\'d want to try to share some sort of skill or something with them that will benefit them as well. But... I\\'ve always had the insight to know that actually *being* in a relationship with such a person wouldn\\'t work out- not without that connection, that comfort. So I restrained myself appropriately so as not to enter into unsuitable relationships. Focused on learning what I could and improving myself in the hopes of becoming someone my ideal partner would like to date... if I\\'d ever meet him. Well, we met and we\\'ve married!

I never planned on going to college so grades meant nothing to me. All I wanted to do was graduate so I would never have to go to school again. Because of that I thought the whole thing was a huge waste of my time and I felt compelled to do nothing whenever possible. Doing anything meant I was a part of their system and I despised the thought of that. I put in minimal effort and put everything off until the last minute or didn't do it at all if I could get away with it. There were people who would be disappointed when they got a B, but I would celebrate when I got a D because it meant I passed. I felt like school was hell and it would never end. Then one day I finally graduated with the minimum credits needed and I had to make up a lot of work at the end of the year. I had to sit in detention for weeks all day which was even worse than being in class. You probably don't care about my story, but I was just trying to say I hated school as much as you do. So then on to the point I want to make. I'm finally out of school, great right? Well now that I'm out of school I have to find a job and where do I end up? Working a shitty factory job with bad conditions that didn't pay that well. That job made going to school look like a cake walk. I was there for around a month before they finally fired me. After that I sat and did nothing everyday for over a year which got me nowhere. Now I've been at another shitty job and who knows if I'll get fired again. Maybe you know of something you want to do after you're done with school, but I never did and I ended up where I am now. School may not be that important to you, but you could be setting yourself up to feel the same way about your life. Before you know It you will be looking back and realize its not as bad as you think. I always hated hearing that, but didn't realize it was true until it was over.\\n\", \"Anger comes from pain. Your probably experiencing a lot of pain and you get these ideas sort of naturally, just your predisposition. But hurting others wouldn't really change that, it would make things worse, and it would be horrible for the others just like it would be horrible if it happened to you. You probably know that anyways. You should definitely get help in dealing with this. You know it's a problem. I would say it's more like ideas in your mind, just like there are a lot of ideas like this on TV shows and movies. I saw something somewhere where some people have thoughts, sort of on the level of ideas, of killing people often, when they are angry. They wouldn't do it, but their minds work like that. For some people, that comes with feeling angry. But then, a lot of times they don't even know that first they feel pain, then they feel angry. That's part of what you can talk about with a therapist. It's actually pretty thoughtful of you to post this on here because it just shows that you're thinking about it. I think it's important to remember that, as strange as this may seem, even when you have thoughts like this, its an expression of the opposite. It's an expression of caring about the world but things aren't going right or working out right. I guess it's a way of being mad at the world. Which we all get like sometimes. But nothing is worked out at the level of killing yourself or others. Things only get worked out as you live your life. Definitely get help and tell them about your thoughts. If you can, when you start thinking like that, just start pulling out and say to yourself that this is not a good direction. Something tells me you've developed a bad habit of thinking like this, almost like a TV show about such horrible things, but don't let your mind go there. It might go there a little bit, just like it does for most people, but don't keep going there. It's just a big mistake, but it seems like you don't quite realize that. It's almost like a bad habit. Even if you feel a lot of pain, and that does happen at times, you don't have to go there and, it's really wouldn't help at all. It would make things much, much worse. I think your mom is wrong on this one. You're the smart one here. I think that if you feel like killing yourself or others you can actually call the police aand they might take you to the hospital but don't be threatening on the phone or in person, of course. Just be calm. but if you wait for the evaluation, then you should tell them in the evaluation. A lot of people might be afraid to answer your post. They don't want to say the wrong thing.

I'm 22 years, and though I've never been officially diagnosed, I am 99% certain I had social phobia when I was younger. (When I was 14, I could hardly speak to classmates I had known for over 8 years) I found out that there was something called social phobia/anxiety when I was around 14 or 15. Until then I had just thought I was a freak, and knowing that there were people struggling with the same things as me really helped. The thing I found that helped me a lot was finding something I excelled at. For me, that was drawing and music. As afraid as I was of having 1:1 interactions, I never had a problem with standing in front of a crowd weirdly enough, since I could rehearse exactly what I was going to do on stage. I played the violin, and got a lot of compliments whenever I played at school events. Since I drew a lot I got better and better and started to get compliments on that too. Finding ways to building up self confidence is step one to overcoming an anxiety! My biggest problem was breaking out of the mold I had made for myself. From the little interactions I had with my classmates, I had been categorized as the shy girl who always cried and rarely spoke. When people have preconceptions of you like that, it's hard to change yourself! In the end, although I had already started working on many things, any outward changes didn't happen until I changed school. I cut ties with all my old classmates and tried to think forwards rather than back. I was still nervous as fuck, but I got very lucky and met two girls who shared my interests! The first weeks of school was hell, and I left drained every night after forcing myself to walk over to these girls between class. After about a week I got so nervous that I didn't dare walk over to them again, but *luckily* they came to me instead. During the three years at that school I really developed, and my new friends helped me a lot along the way. But there is *no way* I would have done this way in my old environment. In a way, my new friends were getting to know me at the same time as *I* was getting to know me. On a related note, I find that going back to my old school makes me feel 14 again, and not in a good way. When I've bumped into old classmates I almost revert back to my more anxious self, just because that's the way that these people remember me as and so they talk to me expecting me to be the same. Your environment and associations have a lot to say about how you are going to behave. I find that what you are talking about in your post is what I was like in the beginning, but it will only take you so far. If you are always acting out a personality that is not your own, you'll not get rid of those deep-seeded insecurity. It's like pushing dust under a rug - the dust is still there! What I found works better is instead of constructing a personality, you should find things about yourself that you like and grow the rest of you around that. That way, when someone compliments you they are complimenting *you*. This is going to require some self-awareness. The first step is getting to know yourself and what you'd be like without the anxiety. Be self-aware, but don't fall into self-pity. I'm not going to sugarcoat anything. It's going to be rough, but you *can do it*. Also, be prepared for a lot of ups-and-downs. Though I don't think I'd qualify for social anxiety anymore, I still have good days and bad days, and on the bad days I'd rather not talk to anyone. There is no way to flip a switch to make it go away, but it can get so much better! Tl;dr: don't fake confidence, *get* confidence.\\n\", 'You aren\\'t insane. I finally got therapy after my bf died.

Stop drinking coffe and any caffeinated drinks (anything but herbal teas, coke/pepsi, energy drinks). Staying away from drugs and alcohol should be a no-brainer. Start working out if you're not already. This should lower both your anxiety levels as well as improving the quality of your sleep. It's the endorphins you're after, so long workouts are best. 45 mins 3 times a week of continuous running/fast walking for instance. It's hard to give anything more detailed without knowing your physical condition, but most gyms will offer to make a workout suited to you at a reasonable price. Different types of meditation could also be an idea. ACEM-meditation is a non-religious method that has been proven to reduce stress levels as well as improve sleep quality. I'd have a look at their homepage to see if they have any instructors in your area: http://www.acem.com/acem_sites/acem_com/the_organization The more classical schools tend to focus on concentration and exploration of the mind and/or religious ideas. While I'd recommend ACEM for you, there are some tricks regarding concentration that can be helpful during an actual anxiety attack. It is possible to block out what's in your mind and only experience the physical symptoms. I do this by focusing intently on a small piece of a melody or any constant source of sound that can distract me (a mantra of sorts I guess). You also want to try to relax as much as possible while doing this. Slow down your breathing as much as possible at the onset of an attack and try to find something to occupy your mind. Your mind is trying to rationalize an irrational fear which is why things around you or in your mind can appear to be the cause (they're not of course). Try to maintain a sound sleep schedule. Looking into other causes of bad sleep with a physician could be a good idea. Also be aware that some physicians tend to prescribe medication out of the blue. Without me being qualified in any way to comment on this, mine said you'd want to avoid that for younger people as much as possible. I'd discuss it with a therapist (psychologist) and ideally a specialist (psychiatrist) over a general practitioner if it comes to that. edit: Make sure your don't go around hungry. Low blood sugar heightens the risk of anxiety attacks. Don't eat big meals before you go to bed, but make sure you don't go to bed hungry.

Along with my SA, I get anxious from intimacy (before, during, and after). This has ultimately altered my sexual performance and has caused strain in my past relationships. I\\'m definitely submissive and the idea of a guy being submissive in a sexual relationship is (wrongfully) looked down upon. In past sexual relationships I\\'ve managed to get lucky and find myself wrapped up with women who took on a more dominant role or at least realized that I wasn\\'t going to go ahead and do it. Eventually certain relationships would take the direction of completely emasculating me in the bedroom with the underlying pretense of it being \\'play\\'. This was comforting because I knew the things she was doing was not in direct response to my performance or what have you but it was a response to the assumed role that we had delegated ourselves. There\\'s probably a lot more to it; self-confidence issues, lack of dominant figures in my life otherwise, the void developed from the lack of control one develops when suffering from anxiety and having someone you\\'re emotionally and sexually attracted to fill it, etc. &gt;other times I think perhaps its only reinforcing the underlying cognition of the social anxiety, and feeding me with negative energy. This is something I can relate to as well. It might be nuanced for me because I don\\'t really watch humiliation porn but there was an instance in the past of having a girlfriend dominate me emotionally and physically.

I've been through a similar experience, and I know it's cliche to say this, but it does get better. On Dec. 31st of 2016 I started dating this girl named Ray. I loved her with everything in me, and would do anything just to keep her happy. She was my everything. Sadly though, a fell into a very dark place during the last month of our relationship. Things at home (btw, we weren't living together yet) were getting really bad. So bad in fact, that I almost ended it. I didn't know how to handle my feelings. I had no one to go to for help. I was getting ready to enlist for the military, and I was afraid I'd I did turn to someone for help and the military found out, they'd never let me in. So I was stuck. I didn't want to tell Ray what was going on at the time because I didn't want her to worry, and I could see that it was torturing her because she couldn't help. Since my sadness was also making her sad, I ended it between us. I also ended because I honestly didn't think I was going to be alive for much longer and I didn't want her to have to go through that. Fast forward 9 months later and it's Decmber of 2017. Everyday after we broke up, I thought about her. I still loved her, but the friends we shared says that she didn't feel the same way. Plus, I still felt guilty over the whole situation. I wanted to be with her again, but I knew it wouldn't be the same. I was like you. I wanted her back badly, and when I found out she liked someone else it killed me. I too asked myself when the thoughts would end; about when I would stop thinking about her every damn day. That December, I decided to write her a letter explaining everything. To my surprise, she wrote back. She positively told me that she understood everything, and at that moment I finally received closure. Now I'm okay to be honest. I don't think about her anymore unless I have to, and I don't talk about her with any of my friends anymore like I used to. What I think you need is closure, too. I couldn't tell you how to get it because it's honestly up to you how you get closure. I just hope you have the best of luck with it, and I hope I've helped on some way. And about the anger side of things, try some exercises to call yourself down. I too have some pretty bad angry fits at times. I run on a treadmill when I feel upset, and I've also picked up some new hobbies to keep my mind off of the anger when it hits (guitar and wood working are the hobbies). I've also read that yoga and meditation help pretty well also, so maybe you could give those a try.

Is there anyone you feel emotionally and physically safe around? Someone whose presence eases you a little? If so, give them a call or text. Tell them you're not doing well, give them however many details you're comfortable with, and ask if you can go somewhere together. Maybe just drive around town. Maybe a park, lots of open space and fresh air, and (if you have the right park) not a lot of people. Just getting beyond that door will do you a world of good.

Don't even question it, just call. If you can't call, get out among people even if it means wandering the aisles at the only Walmart open all night or sitting in a booth at the Awful Waffle at 2 a.m. This sounds like suicidal ideation, rather than feeling actively suicidal. I went through many, many years of this feeling. I didn't want to kill myself, but suicide, death, and dying were very frequent, prominent thoughts. I'd also wondered what it would be like to do random hurtful things, like put my hand under a running lawn mower or drive into a median. (Do not do these things.) Sometimes I'd indulge the thoughts, other times I'd be scared that I felt this way and just knew I was crazy, feared I really could do something terrible on impulse one day - lots of anxiety and what ifs. After getting trauma therapy and medication that worked properly for depression and anxiety, I realized I wasn't crazy, just not well and needed the right help, and had my own work to do. If you're able, please start seeing a counselor and be totally honest and open about everything. If cost is a deterrent, ask about counselors who do pro bono or sliding scale work. If that doesn't pan out, start sitting in at support groups for depression, anxiety, grief, OCD, trauma - anything that seems like a reasonable place to start. (I strongly recommend this anyway) Tons of churches offer support groups if you can't find one that's close and not spiritual. Don't be put off by the religious aspect right off the bat if you're not into religion, because a lot that I've attended aren't pushy and (as with everything) you can take what works and leave the rest. If there's been substance trouble or abuse in your life or a close relationship, other good support resources to look at are Alanon and AA. I'm throwing a lot out here, but I'm thinking of addressing the reasons why you feel suicidal and off. That's the root cause you'll have to untangle and heal when you're ready.

That being said, what triggers your anger, friend?\\n\", \"I had a similar problem in the past. Everything seemed to set me off, but then my son gave me this book on anger. I'll see if I can find it and edit in the title later today. But the jest of the book was one central point... Anger is a choice. You choose your reaction to everything. There is that split second between some stimulus and your reaction where you decide. The choice of anger can become habit forming and like most habits hard to break. But you need to be considering the alternatives and sometimes (more likely most times from my experience) choosing a non-anger reaction. This doesn't mean you can never make the anger choice, but with most situations, it doesn't help anyway. A typical non-anger choice for conflicting situations might be to ask the other person why they would do or say such a thing. Sometimes it is just to walk away. This won't be easy, especially at first, but you will learn to catch that moment of choice and learn that alternatives are available. Now that I've learned how, I feel so much better, and can even chuckle when someone says something that would have triggered me in the past. Good luck.\\n\", \"That's how I felt at the party I was at. You're not alone.

I do everything, because he usually can't. I know he's not being lazy, and I know he's just hiding away from everything because he doesn't feel strong enough to face reality, but it's still really hard to watch him sit around all day playing video games while I do all the cooking, and the dishes, and keep the place as clean &amp; tidy as I can without setting him off, and work/attempt to find work (I had a job before we moved), and meal plan, and do all the grocery shopping, and stick to a budget, and still be ok with it. I don't mean to be rude but that doesn't sound like social anxiety to me. More like 'intensely lazy', 'rude' or 'manipulative'. Wasting his life by just playing video games, and not doing chores and finding work goes beyond the scope of social anxiety, and just uses it as a mere excuse.

Everything you are doing to be aware of your mood when specific things happen and the exact things that trigger you is time well spent. So be sure to cut yourself some slack and try not to get mad at yourself for getting mad, if you know what I mean. You're working on it, so if you get mad, replay what happened and ask yourself a few questions for the immediate thing that just happened and you got mad. These questions are for whatever just occurred and made you mad (not a historical or lifelong analysis - literally, what just happened in the last five, ten twenty minutes - really try to delineate specific events and emotions as they played out): * When exactly was it that I first started feeling strong emotions? * What were those feelings and was it something someone said? * What assumptions did I have that made the emotions start escalating? * Is there a story that pops in my head that makes me defensive or feeling like I'm being judged? What is that story and is it realistic? In anger management books, anger is often called a secondary emotion because it comes after another emotion is stimulated. As an example, when someone criticizes you at work you first might feel affronted, shame, guilt, defensive, all kinds of things come up depending on what is happening. Whether you are right or wrong, that can bring up a lot of different thoughts and if we don't learn a perspective for going through the thought process that results in constructive interaction, we can jump to getting really angry very quickly. Anger is associated with the fight or flight response (controlled by the amygdala). So when you get that initial anger response, fast pulse, ready to stand up and throw a lamp at somebody, that's the fight or flight response. The fuse, whether it's long or short is the distance between the initial emotions and the time it takes for your rational mind to come back so you can properly evaluate what is going on. So the sooner you can recognize something is triggering you and slow things down for yourself by separating yourself from the triggering event or person, going for a walk, saying I'll be back in 15 minutes and we can discuss, etc., the sooner you can deal with things in a more measured approach. Perspective is important. And a way to put things into perspective is to remind yourself: * I don't have to be right. * There are different ways of doing things. * Nobody can read my mind and I can't read theirs. * We have to talk things out to reach a mutually agreed approach. * Sometimes I won't get my way and that's ok. * My relationship with my coworkers is more important than this tiny issue. Improving your ability to take criticism without taking it personally and to negotiate solutions are huge skills that help and you can work on them at the same time. Books like Difficult Conversations can be helpful with that. If you want something to follow up on I always recommend [Anger Management for Dummies](https://hmt.es/Anger%20Management%20For%20Dummies.pdf) because it's a direct approach and it also shows how to find resources you need, depending on your situation. For you I would also recommend one of my favorite books [Take Charge of Your Life](http://carolsnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Take-Charge-of-Your-Life.pdf) by William Glasser. He's the creator of Choice Theory / Reality Therapy and for me this book explains it the best. It's a great complementary approach to CBT but honestly I feel a lot more empowering. I hope this helps you! Good luck! Edit: Sometimes you only need a 15 minute break to cool down. But if you are getting really worked up, you should take up to an hour. If you come back, talk more and get worked up again, take another hour. You can also wait until the next day if the situation allows. That way you can manage your reaction and response.\\n\", \"Thank you for this. I am having a rough night. I was supposed to be spending tonight with my boyfriend but he broke up with me on Monday.

I\\'ll tell you what I found and you can decide if it feels right to you. As a kid, I actually was furious and outraged at the abuse, but it was impotent rage and expressing it in any way only made the situation worse for me, so I learned to push it down and ignore it. The problem is that it was actually legitimate anger. The purpose of anger is to destroy injustice or prevent harm, but as a kid I wasn\\'t capable of either - hence the abuse. But it was still there and it was still real and instead of directing it where it belonged (at my abusers) I directed it at myself in the form of \"Why are you so weak?\" \"Whey do you let this bother you?\" \"What\\'s wrong with me for being so upset all the time?\" Years of carrying around all that anger and pushing it down and before I know it anger is leaking out all over the place. It boils over at family, at friends, at coworkers, even at strangers. The thing is, if that anger wasn\\'t in me and already close to the surface, I wouldn\\'t have to worry about it coming out inappropriately (i.e., when there is no injustice or imminent harm). So the key was to let it go where it belonged and really allow myself to feel the rage, pain, sorry, disappointment, betrayal, and thorough injustice and harm of the abuse and point that anger where it belongs, at the abuser (emotionally speaking, though possibly not literally in a physical way) and let it go. As I\\'ve learned to allow all the emotions to do their jobs I\\'ve learned I\\'m much more emotionally capable and competent than I\\'d ever realized. Depression, shame, and addiction are being replaced by connection, joy, and ambition. It\\'s almost hard to understand, but there are a few key emotions that work in really simple ways, but are capable of absolutely wreaking havoc if not listened to or allowed to do their jobs.

One thing that is [apparently known](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-still-under-construction/index.shtml) is that the adolescent brain is undergoing a lot of changes right through the early 20s (and up to the early 30s), so don't expect it to last forever. There are many things you can do; one is to read up more on the brain, the mind and how it changes. If you look back through some of my posts, you'll see a few book recommendations. The best (as in *most helpful*) book I've ever read was *The Chimp Paradox*. The other thing is to perhaps engage in some basic meditative techniques; there are tons of free online courses in mindfulness. This helps you study what is actually happening in your body and allows you to identify triggers and deactivate them. The third thing is to talk to somebody about your temper. Talking cannot be underrated. Sometimes it leads the way to much greater clarity. Ignore anyone who tells you to vent your anger...research shows that this leads to greater anger in the future and establishes unhelpful patterns.
