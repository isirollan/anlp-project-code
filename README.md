# ANLP Project Code

In this repository you can find all the coding we used in our project

 ## 1. Data Retrieving Folder

 In this folder you can find the code we used to decompress `.zst` files and save each year in a different Output `.csv` file.

 The order to run this is:
 1. In your terminal run `python3 submission_decompressor.py` changing only `input_file`, `from_date`, and `to_date` accordingly. 
 2. Go to `comment_submission_mix.ipynb` and run all the lines in there changing `comments_input` and `combined_input`.
