"Good. It really helped mine and in a handful of sessions I got a lot of good stuff. Not meant to stress you out, but the first session was really tough, I felt so vulnerable, I could barely talk, it was really the first time I'd ever been just completely open and vulnerable to another person, and it was really overwhelming. The therapist understood, made sure I knew it happened a lot, it was really surprising as I hadn't felt that many emotions for decades and it went way better the second session. Just understand that they have seen it all, they aren't going to judge you, the goal is to just be completely open and honest and answer all their questions so they can help you improve yourself.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

"A few years ago when i was 13 or so I was depressed at times and my parents thought maybe i should see someone to talk about it. The reason i was depressed was because of my anxiety. But because of my anxiety i worried to much about what they would think about me so i never told them even though i went to talk to them 10, maybe more times. I feel stupid just typing it, if anyone should have understood it would have been them. But I guess part of the reason i did that was because i thought maybe if i told them about my anxiety they would tell my parents and i didn't want to have to talk to them about that. I'm 17 now and my parents still don't know about my anxiety.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

"Hi mate, well done for holding things together! If you want a particular therapy or response from your GP, please do not be shy to ask for it or consider changing surgeries. Some GPs are far more informed and referral statistics can differ a lot. It is easy to get stuck - self-diagnosis is never a good idea, and it is extremely difficult to escalate your treatment unless you are an immediate danger to the public or yourself. If you feel your treatment is not finished please keep pursuing it. Taking care of your family is laudable. If you're not 'OK' yourself, then how long will you be able/want to. Thunderhearts advice about 'MIND' is good. best of luck. EDIT - I need to take some of my own advice and change my GP - Ive just moved 3 miles and they'll boot me if they find out... eugh!",2014,mentalhealth,1,0

"On the topic of your handicap, I have crohns myself and was hospitalized from a bad flare. But each day I attempt to live my life as a normal person. If I wanna go out and run, I go out and run. 20% of the time I need a bathroom in the first three minutes, in a major city you can always find a bathroom nearby. Frequently, I have extremely bad gas at in opportune times, in these situations I just excuse myself and explain I have a condition. So on the topic of your handicap, attempt to live as normally as possible even though at times it is tough. On the topic of loneliness, I have learned that loneliness can be a relative idea(still very real). Every summer for 18 years of my life, I had almost no contact with any of my friends. Most would think that this was horrible, but I was never depressed or lonely over this, however I was lonely living in a major city. So my suggestion is to find yourself as much as possible, dont worry about the people that get a 100 facebook likes and are always posting pictures(because they are probably just as lonely as you on the inside), and to attempt to find new common hobbies with new people. Go do yoga, or run, or rock climb. None of this will fix depression on its own, but life will be more livable. My guess is that you would have some moderate level of depression if you seem to feel so alone. I would recommend visiting a therapist and allowing them to evaluate you.

"I had this anxiety too. It all started when a toxic ex-friend of mine lashed out at me via text. I liked her and all, and we were going along pretty well. Seems like she had been holding something against me for long an instead of telling me, she sent me mean and hateful texts. Like really bad stuff, stuff you do not want to hear from someone you love and trust. And when I composed the most thoughtful,apologetic and loving response and texted her back, I got more and more hate messages. She twisted the meaning of my words and all. The friendship fell apart (thankfully,in hindsight) and somehow I developed a strong aversion to texting. I avoided sending messages for fear of being misunderstood. In my head I called her deed ""textual harassment"" (lol). I didn't alltogether stopped texting then, but I keep a few points in my mind while I send a text, which are : 1)Its okay if they don't reply back immediately. 2) If they do not reply back after 1-2 days I will re-send my text without nagging or anything. If they complain I simply say ""Ohh you didn't reply so I thought it failed to send"". 3) Its okay if I do not want to text back right away. 4) If someone nags me for not replying within seconds, I simply tell them I didn't have the time to reply then and there (no apologies, just a statement). 5) If someone twists my words and plays mind games, I immediately stop.I control my phone and NOT vice-versa. 6) If someone tries to nastily bring up that texting-session in a conversation I tell them not to make such a small thing an issue and get up and leave. If they quarrel and shit, they are not your friends. Leave. Remember : YOU control your phone. :) Also I avoid using free texting services like Whatsapp and kik and all. There is a reason SMS was a paid service. :P Now it is free and being overused so much and for so shitty reasons it makes me laugh :P You say in your post you have successfully overcome anxiety in face to face communications. So this texting shit is a piece of cake for you :) :) Hope that helps. God Bless :)",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
Some what related I fear internet messages. If someone messages me on Facebook I will often pretend I did not see the message.

"I experience this everyday. I am 22/f and my SO is going to be 27. I never want to go out into public because him and I always seem to run into this one girl all... the... time... I believe we've run into her at least 5 or 6 times in the past few months. She has this voice that makes my stomach drop every time she sees him. The last occurrence happened just the other day, actually. We were in the grocery store waiting in line. A former teacher of his had called out his name so he told me to hold the spot in line. After that conversation, he was coming back to the line with me, but then I hear the girl's voice saying ""hey!"" and him replying back saying ""Hey, sunshine!"". I just kept telling myself ""Don't freak out..."" and I was trying to listen in on their conversation and she had said, ""Still with your girl, are you?"" And that is when I lost it in my head, but had to keep my composure in public. This girl he had met at a sandwich shop because he frequented there, and apparently she's been with her boyfriend for two years, but after they had finished talking she hugged him, which according to him, she's never done, and I completely lost it on him in the car on the way home... reason being, I had visited the store she worked at once, and she didn't acknowledge me whatsoever and that just put me off completely. I have very bad jealously issues along with a long list of others. I figured I'd share and let you know that you aren't the only one. I haven't found a way to cope. I don't drink, smoke, anything.

"I know what you mean man (not so extensively I might add) But I've always, always had an anger streak in me. these days I have little venting opportunity other than my martial arts training. I know exactly how it feels when the unshackled rage takes over and you feel like your one purpose for existence is to destroy everything within 20 feet of you. I was sweet on a girl for half a year once, a few years back, she was a beautiful red-head and I'll never forget her, or at least so I thought. a few months in to the relationship I noticed she was being off with me and when I finally confronted her (over social networking no less) she admitted she had slept with one of my closest friends at the time. Me being the smitten, in love moron that I was decided to forgive them both, as they did both seem genuine in their apologies, and everything was fine from then on. But it wasn't. She was never the same after that, and eventually she broke up with me and I sat there aftwerwards thinking, what did I just waste 4 months on? for about a year after that relationship I was the same in terms of that anger that just ruins your day when you think of it, eventually I accepted it and realised she wasn't and still isn't worth my emotional energy (being really angry is quite tiring). The only satisfying solution I've ever found to this kind of brooding anger is to literally, physically and mentally vent it. do something that actually requires anger and determination, like martial arts training and/or exercise with it.

Thats when Ill throw one a few episodes of TV ill start with dramas and finish on comedies, watch a movie or catch up on that game. Even if its only 30 mins to an Hour.

It really is just a vicious, endless cycle. I have been like this for the past 2 years, especially now that I have a job. And more recently, it's been the one thing that has served as a reminder that I am depressed and need help (which I'm finally doing). Spending all my time at work, then coming home to sleep, and then going back to work because anything else feels unproductive, is no way to live; my friends have reminded me consistently about that.

I even plan ""relaxation"" time, but feel guilty for not reading, when I've watched a movie instead. When I sleep, I constantly check my phone and realise that I have ""6 hours left"" or ""maybe I can get 3 more hours if I just stop thinking about it"". When it comes to waking up 1-2 hours before my alarm goes off, going back to sleep is impossible. The weekends are slightly easier because of a lie-in.

"A: What kind of tools do you have for dealing with going outside for other appointments or errands? Do you wear headphones that play soothing music? Wear dark sunglasses to help the world seem smaller and less bright? Wear clothes that are comfortable and safe-feeling to you? If you can find something that makes the travel to and from your appointment moderately bearable you will have conquered a major obstacle for any therapy you will be doing, regardless of who with. B: When you (and by you I mean all of us who suffer/have suffered from extreme anxiety and/or agoraphobia) are in the grip of a panic attack/phobic attack or have been put into a situation that is calling for you to confront those anxieties, it is easy to project your fear and anger onto the person or object causing the confrontation. When your psychiatrist puts a condition on your prescription, she is trying to get you to deal with your conditioned response to your anxiety (hiding at home, passing out, sleeping for days). By attending your session next week, no matter how hard it is or how bad it makes you feel, you are showing her that you care about your self and your future, no just taking medication for the rest of your life. Psychiatrists have a bad rap for being pill dispensers. Medication is only effective in the long run if you deal with the issues that bring you to need the drugs in the first place. For now you need to build a toolkit of resources that will allow you to take this one baby step...getting to your therapy appointments. Later you will use those appointments to add more tools to your arsenal and you will be able to accomplish more and feel better about yourself while you do it. Eventually you may get to the point where you only need to see her (or someone else) every 6 months for refills. But for now, baby steps. Spend each day over the next week thinking of all the ways you can make sure you make it to your appointment. Find a way to reward yourself once you have accomplished your task. Talk to your psychiatrist about what kind of a plan she has in mind for your cognitive therapy. Sometimes knowing what you have to look forward to every week can help prepare you for leaving the house. Just be good to yourself.

"It means your emotions are more intense and longer lasting than those of neurotypicals. You have an excessive tendency to fear rejection and abandonment and this fear can dominate your life if you allow it to - so don't. You are in charge of yourself. You are the only one who chooses how you react to your emotions. It is in your power to react to emotions constructively or destructively. It is important first and foremost to pay close attention to yourself, to your mind. Watch your mind like a hawk. Stand like a TSA agent at the gateway of your mind. Check everything that goes in and everything that comes out. Find out why you do every single thing you do, why you believe what you believe, why you want what you want. This takes time and diligent effort but the insights you will gain will be worth it a zillion times over. You must learn how to stop yourself from saying hurtful things to other people no matter how strongly triggered you are. You must *never* blame another person for your pain. You must refrain at all costs from taking on the self-image of ""the victim"" for this will destroy relationships faster than anything. No one is responsible for how you feel but you. No one can change your self-esteem but you. No one can make you feel like shit or like god. You cannot control your emotions once triggered but you do have a lot of options about how to react to these emotions. You can give them more energy until they're so powerful they overwhelm you or you can give them so little energy that they wither away in a short time. All this takes practice but all can be done if one is sincere and persistent. Do not suppress your emotions and try to avoid feeling them. No matter how much they may hurt, do not run away from them. Instead, look at them like a detective solving a crime. Where do these emotions come from? Why do they trigger you in this way? Investigate them. Never ever take them for granted and assume their strength and tenacity mean they are appropriate. Emotions can lie and confuse. Be very very careful about how you react to them. If you do, you can turn them around and make positive use of your hypersensitivity. You must learn to observe your mind at all times. You must also learn to read other people. What are they feeling? How are they responding to you or to circumstances? All people need affirmation. If you make people feel bad about themselves, they will not want to be around you. It's as simple as that. Do your best not to make anyone feel bad when you feel bad and make sure you don't make them feel bad about themselves or blame themselves for your pain or your problems. You are the only one in charge of your mind. Only you can cause yourself to suffer; no one else. Only you can become enlightened, aware and free to use your intelligence without it being influenced or distorted by your conditioning. (Enlightenment means knowing the true nature of the self and of phenomena. Buddhism can be very helpful as a means of attaining insights into the nature of the essential ""I"" that, unlike the brain, cannot be conditioned. Look into it. Marsha Linehan invented DBT based on her Buddhist meditation practice.) Learn all the social skills you can and make learning these into an ongoing, lifelong study. Educate yourself. Information will be your greatest weapon against pain, confusion and frustration. Know what to expect of yourself and others. Question yourself when you think you are 100% sure about something. Never allow yourself 100% certainty because that's not how things work in this universe. Never allow yourself to simplify a situation until it looks all good or all bad. Black and white thinking is not accurate; it is a mistake. Do not ever believe than any person is either all bad or all good. Good deeds don't negate bad ones and bad deeds can't negate good ones. Learn that all people have both good and bad traits including yourself. Try to view things as accurately as possible at all times, especially your own mind. Learn that you are responsible for your mind and your own mental turmoil. You must learn how to deal with your emotions skillfully, quickly and effectively. Marsha Linehan and DBT training is *very* helpful. Master DBT and then master it again and again. DBT has great tips for *all* of us not just those with BPD. Tread lightly. Look for happiness in small things. Be gentle to yourself and to others. You will never regret being gentle and tentative rather than forceful and brash. Whenever pain arises, take it as a warning that you may be making a mistake. Don't trust emotions to be accurate. They never are. They cannot ever be trusted. Use cognition every time strong emotions try to take over. An emotion should never be allowed at the steering wheel. Be on the alert for rouge emotions and keep them in their place at all times like a boss. Don't allow yourself to explode and rage and yell and insult other people. Don't attack anyone no matter what your emotions tell you they deserve. Sit quietly and investigate when emotional problems arise. Investigate each one very carefully, just like a scientist. Where did this emotion come from? Why is it here? Is it legit or not? Don't lash out at yourself or others. There's no point to it. It NEVER helps to be mean and self-hate is a complete waste of time. Nip it in the bud before it grows into a monster. When you are in pain, you must be gentle to avoid creating more pain for yourself and for others. Be very careful about how you create and reinvent your self-image. Be very humble and always ready to admit your mistakes with utter sincerity - especially to yourself. Don't let your self-image become that of a helpless victim. This is a critical point. If you allow yourself to view yourself as a victim, this mistake will cripple you and destroy relationships. Cultivate self-restraint at all times like an Olympic athelete cultivates the skills required by their sport. Slow down when problems arise. Never panic. If something isn't urgent, don't treat it as if it were to motivate yourself. Never use negative reinforcement on yourself. Treat yourself like a very sensitive, very intelligent animal you need to protect and love and care for. Never think ""I am the victim of so-and-so"". Never think ""so-and-so hurt me"" or ""so-and-so is responsible for how bad I feel and the terrible things I've said and done because so-and-so made me feel bad."" These are lies your troll brain will pull out often during life. There is a small, persistent, petty and misguided part of us that seeks to blame others for our troubles. You must never feed it. You *must* own your own mind and all that it puts forth - there is no other option. Fear will be your greatest obstacle. It is that way for all of us. Fear will preclude love, creativity and understanding. If fear becomes a problem for you, look into it with scientific precision. Don't just look into the fear of this or the fear of that; look into fear itself. Look deeply and then more deeply. What is fear? Where does fear come from? Why does fear arise? Can fear be trusted? Is it beneficial? Does it have a role in your life or not? Whatever else you do, pay special attention to fear whenever it pops up, and always be its master- not the other way around. If fear is allowed to guide the course of your life, it will bring only more fear; not security. Do not make self-concern your entire preoccupation in life. Do not worry about your own security - either psychological or physical - above all other things. Don't turn your desire for security into a prison from which you cannot escape. Don't allow *worrying about yourself* to dominate your life. Whenever you feel fear about your own personal security, stop and find out whether or not it is legit. Look around yourself objectively, like a zebra scenting a predator. Are you in real danger? Are you facing a life or death situation or not? Your emotions will tend to be too strong, too overpowering and so you must not trust them or allow them to overpower your intelligence. Do *not* let fear for your own safety to be your guide. Don't trust it. Don't give into its demands or it will destroy your ability to enjoy life. Understand that love and fear cannot coexist in one mind. Choose love. Don't demand that love come to you from outside of you. Never think that you can fulfill your need for love by seeking it outside of yourself. Those who seek love from outside will *never* find it. *If you want more love, you must love more.* There is no other way. Love always comes from within you even when you think it is coming from another person. Love is not a thing that can be asked for or held onto. If you try to grasp it, you will kill it for it is alive. All those who seek love outside of themselves will only find frustration, loneliness and sorrow. When you yourself are full of love, you will not worry about whether or not you are loved by any others. Love is a type of activity. It cannot be stored up and used later. Love is always new. Love isn't an object that anyone can posses. It is not like money in the bank. It is, rather, a way of relating to what's around you. It comes from within you. Always. Cultivate the ability to endure pain without giving rise to the slightest bit of aggression. This is of immense value. If pain, emotional or physical, causes you to lash out and become aggressive, you will suffer even more pain and so will all those around you. If you forget everything else, at least remember this: You must learn to endure pain without giving rise to the slightest aggression. It's worth saying twice or even more. If you master this skill, your life will be easier and happier. You will have better relationships and fewer problems and conflicts. If pain makes you attack and say or do hurtful things, this unskillful behavior will lead to more pain. Once this fact is understood, you will be able to stop yourself with a simple reminder: ""I want LESS pain. I will not do anything that might lead to MORE pain."" No one is simply a disorder. We are all people who have disorders. The vast majority of our disorders are NOT our fault. We live in very difficult times. Our society is harsh, cruel, misguided, unpredictable, selfish, primitive, confused, violent, merciless, twisted and destructive. This is obvious. When a person is forced to grow up in a sick and coercive culture, disorders are the consequence. I have a theory that these days, almost all of us humans are insane or terribly crippled because our culture is profoundly sick. We must learn how to be appropriate without the guidance of mainstream sources. Here are a few sources, besides Marsha Linehan, you will find helpful: YouTube videos or articles about the causes of mental illness in our time by Bruce Levine, Gabor Mate and Bruce Alexander. These will point you to others. Humans who have influenced me most recently include J. Krishnamurti - who describes very accurately what freedom is and how to have it. He also has profound insight into the nature of fear, love, interpersonal conflict and all the rest of the problems we humans face. Jacque Fresco is an engineer who is also a genius and a visionary. His recent Venus Project fundraising campaign was very successful. His ideas about how humans might organize themselves and relate to one another differently are incredibly inspiring. Watch the short documentary called *Paradise or Oblivion* on YouTube and see for yourself. Fresco pinpoints why our current way of life is making us sick, hurt and desperately lonely. Another smart guy is Slavoj Zizek though I only recently discovered him. He understands that our culture must be transformed if our species is to survive. He tends to be a tad too academic and philosophical for my tastes, but he's got a very good brain and gems can come from his mouth at times. He also ha a great deal of strength and self-assurance which are admirable. I could go on and on but no one reads walls of text anymore. Feel free to contact me anytime you have questions. I know too much about BPD &amp; maybe I can help.",2014,mentalhealth,1,0
You're not hopeless at all. Don't listen to the armchair psychologists and ignorant jerks out there who know nothing about BPD but have no problem parroting back false and harmful stereotypes about it.

"To reiterate what someone else said, be careful about what you read. A lot of people, including therapists, seem to think of BPD as a kiss of death. However: I just bought a book for my fiance called ""Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder"" by Shari Manning. And of course, I started reading it before he even got a chance. And it shocked me. Because this author doesn't behave like so many other authors and tell readers to run like hell away from anyone with BPD. She... she actually loves people with BPD. She thinks we're beautiful, despite our chaos. And holy shit, this is the first thing I've read that doesn't make me feel like a monster. So, I'd highly recommend the purchase. Even if it's just for you. It doesn't matter that the book is directed at those on the outside looking in. The author is also super into DBT, which is pretty much saving my life right now. =)",2014,mentalhealth,1,0

"Are you seeing a therapist? If so, have you talked to him/her about this? If not, how often do you see your prescriber?

If you don't feel comfortable doing that, talk to the school counselor or psychologist at your school ASAP. I hope this helps in some way.

"This is the bane of my educational existence and something I go through EVERY term: having to find courses that won't make you present class projects, give speeches, have group discussions, etc. It's very, very frustrating, especially since I'm an English major, and all I want to do is read literature and write. Is that too much to ask? It's even worse that teachers seem to think that gathering desks into a circle for class discussion is terrific. ""Hey, let's just SHARE!"" No, why don't you just teach and quit trying to give me a panic attack? I already dropped one class this term since each student was expected to lead an ""expert panel"" on some literary topic. So I enrolled into a folklore course on ""food and family,"" thinking I would be OK, but, as it turns out, we have to read our ""refrigerator food list"" tomorrow in front of the class. This will be followed by a ten minute team discussion on a personal family dish that we'll have to study. Son of a bitch. Why do educators believe that everyone is fine with this classroom style? Of course, the problem is that teachers tend to be very outgoing, and those type of folks just don't under SA. ""Just go up there and do it! You'll be fine!"" I'm always happy when I find an old-school teacher who just lectures. Some people find that boring -- I call it learning.

Man I don't have any advice but I can identify. Was 8 months unemployed and living at home and sometimes I just get so agitated I don't know what to do. It's like I want to scream or jump out of my skin or something but I can't. When I'm like that I can be really unkind to people. Like you I don't know what the problem is exactly but I know there is one and like you I can kind of control it. I just tell myself it's a temporary state and I'll feel better tomorrow or another time. Going out with friends helps the most for me and exercise is OK.

"People with Bipolar Disorder, especially type 2 or cyclo (since manic symptoms are not going to be as obvious), can be really hard to diagnose because the depression is going to look identical. It's the mania that makes Bipolar different, and that just depends on reported history. At the very least it sounds like you're not suffering from extreme mania or mixed states. How did you interact with your ADD meds? I'm pretty sure those can trigger mania in bipolar people. Either way, *you need to get to a professional.* You're aware enough to realize what's going on and that you're not functioning well - and while you'll come out of it eventually, with professional intervention you can come out of it sooner, have milder and/or less frequent episodes in the future, and just live a better life. I'm an individual with no insurance and a relatively low income living in the United States. A lot of my medical services are done through training clinics or places that offer sliding scale. There will be some in your area! Please look into it, or if you don't have the energy, ask someone else (including me, if you want) to find some options for you. And regarding medication - there are a huge number of generic antidepressants, and pharmacies are generally willing to work with you on costs. The chances that there are things you have access too and can help you, even without insurance, are very high! And once you do have insurance you can be more picky in the care you receive :) I wish you the best, it's really really hard to be depressed.",2014,mentalhealth,1,0
"I'm no Doctor but I would recommend you do see someone ASAP. What you are describing sounds more like depression than bipolar as you aren't describing any manic type symptoms. It also sounds like you have a few things going on in your life to be concerned, worried, depressed about. I would be trying to find some purpose if I was you. I understand that work is difficult to find at the moment but don't give up. Keep tweaking your resume and keep applying. I always found it useful to ask questions when I am unsuccessful going for a job. Find out what they liked/didn't like and work on the feedback. It's depressing not having a reason to get up in the morning but if you can't find work maybe some volunteering (also looks great on a resume). Find a reason to get up, have a shower, make yourself look and feel good and get out of the house. AND still see a Doctor or Counsellor ASAP Good luck",2014,mentalhealth,1,0

It could be one of hundreds of factors, from something as simple as a dietary cause to a neurochemical imbalance. But there is a cause. Only a doctor can determine if drugs are the right treatment for you. It's also important to remember that 15 years ago when mental illness was not taken quite so seriously, prescribed antidepressants actually caused a lot of people to become worse -- in many cases, a lot worse. So please don't start throwing darts in the dark and self-medicating in the hopes of getting better. My opinion: go talk to someone. It can be a family member if you wish, or a doctor. For me, talking to a counselor/therapist was the best route. They are objective and nonjudgmental. They sincerely want to help you. If you had a sore throat and fever, would you search your house aimlessly for a cause? No, you would go see a doctor because they can tell you what is causing your illness. If you are struggling emotionally, don't go searching aimlessly for a cause. Go talk to someone who can tell you what is causing your illness. There is a theory in psychology called the hydrolic model (want to say Freud developed it?) where it is said that psychic pressure -- bottling up your emotions and thoughts -- can lead to very serious mental health issues from depression to forms of psychosis.

"I've worked in a bottled water factory before. I hated the job itself but it was nice in terms of dealing with the anxiety. There was initial anxiety when I first started the job, figuring out what I was supposed to do, where I was supposed to go, meeting with HR for the interview, training, all that stuff, but once I was past all that, I was generally either left alone or only working with just a handful of people, a couple of direct co-workers and a shift supervisor that would come around and check on things periodically. It was nice just working alone or not having to talk to anybody. I worked in a very noisy part so we had to wear earplugs and it was difficult to talk to anybody anyway. I lasted about a year in that job and I hated it. It was very physically demanding, it was 12 hour shifts, 4 days in a row and then 3 days off. It was also a pain to drive to in the winter, as it was in the middle of nowhere. I used it to pay off some debt, saved up some money and then moved to the city. Now I'm working in an office at an advertising agency and again, most of the time I'm just left alone to do my work. I work closely with a couple of co-workers doing the same job as me and work frequently with other people on my floor but I generally don't mind it. I dislike the job right now but for non anxiety-related reasons. I don't have to talk to many people on the phone (one of my anxiety triggers), most stuff is through email and the company is big enough that I don't have to interact with the higher-up management people. I'm noticeable enough to be recognized that I'm doing a good job but low enough on the totem pole that I'm kind of invisible to anyone higher up. I like it because I'm not dealing with the public, like in a retail setting. I'm in my own office but this floor of the building is kind of a cubicle farm. Just people sitting at their desks doing their work. Some people would hate that but for me, I much prefer it. My triggers are generally large crowds, dealing with the public like in a retail setting, talking on the phone, having to stray from my comfort zone or routine, if I have to go somewhere where I don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going or not knowing how something works like really tall office towers or the court house when I got summoned for Jury Duty. Generally the job I have now in the office, sitting in front of a computer all day lets me avoid these triggers so I like it. You just get stuck in a bit of a rut though and I get very anxious when I think about changing things like looking for a new job.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

"My first meeting was with a psychiatrist and a therapist (actually, a counsellor) and it was really emotional for me. I ended up crying because they asked me about being bullied when I was younger, and I had to explain all of the different things that I think might have contributed to my anxiety. It was sort of embarrassing for me, for a few reasons. But they were being really nice, and patient when I got emotional. It wasn't bad. Edit: I should add that when I initially went, I didn't have a diagnosis. So they asked a lot of questions before they officially labeled me with social anxiety disorder and then the conversation continued from there.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"Every time I see a new therapist, the first meeting is background info and discussion about goals and stuff. Some of them get more personal the first time, but I've found most keep it pretty general. It depends on the therapist really, I think. They shouldn't go deep enough to trigger something that may make you really upset, because that's supposed to come after they establish trust with you. Unless there's something that they don't know is a trigger, or may not be a trigger for most people and they accidentally trigger it. This is just what I've found out in my own therapy experience. I know it's hard to go to that first meeting, but you were able to pick up the phone and call to make the appointment and that's the first step. It's hard, but therapy can have a really good effect if you work at it. I wish you a lot of luck and hope that you get the most that you can out of the experience.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"I finally made an appt to see a therapist a couple weeks ago. I was so anxious about it, almost chickened out last minute and cancelled the appt. I went though. It was a bad experience for me. The therapist didn't make me feel very comfortable...I wanted to cry so bad while talking about some things, but didn't feel like I could. She asked me about money issues (I spend impulsively) even though I didn't have that on my list of issues and then was shaking her head in disappointment while I was explaining. I feel like that's not something a therapist should do. I'm honestly not writing this to scare you away from it, but to let you know that if you're not comfortable with someone and they shake their head at you disappointingly, you do not have any obligation to see them again. I felt pressured in to making another appt with her while we were face to face, but then I called the receptionist and cancelled and told her I wanted to try someone else. do not feel discouraged.

"Well my tip would be to get therapy! And also, just take it slow. Start out smaller than dates. Walk with your co-workers to the train, or something. Do things that are uncomfortable but not impossible before you go on dates. But therapy ; yep",2014,socialanxiety,0,1
"I don't have a cure for you but my advice would be to separate yourself from what happened by taking away any possible blame you might be putting on yourself for it. Nobody deserves to have that happen to them; it's a result of that girl being a shitty person. Only shitty people would do something that cruel. It didn't happen because of anything bad about you: if you didn't click, that's fine, that's pretty likely to happen on random first dates. The main thing is it's not your fault, you did nothing wrong, so don't beat yourself up about it. What happened isn't a common occurrence either; it didn't happen in your 5 other dates, so there's no logical reason to worry about it happening again. (I know we still worry despite knowing this, but it's good to remind yourself). Your social anxiety will stem from somewhere inside, from some insecurity or fear of something that might go wrong. If it's insecurities, remember that nothing you did would have warranted that situation. There's no way you could have actively known how to prevent that situation, so why blame any of your so-called faults? Remember it was her that did this, not you. If it's a fear of things going wrong during social interactions, remember that it's pretty unlikely to happen again. Think about how this is ONE event in your lifetime of hundreds of events. When else has this ever happened? So why is it at all likely to happen again? So why should you fear it? It already happened, and you didn't die, you didn't get laughed at by the whole room, you didn't lose the love of your life, your friends and family didn't immediately ditch you etc: nothing bad has to come of these situations! Nothing horrible is going to happen, and this applies to the other areas of your life too. It's hard but there's a lot less to lose when you go out and start being social, compared to staying at home where you are losing out on all experiences, and it's only going to get worse the longer you wait. So: don't blame yourself, and take it one day and one small step at a time. :)",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"Maybe she had an ""accident""",2014,socialanxiety,0,1
"First of all, if you feel that social anxiety is hampering your life, medical treatment is something you should look into. Now, about your date. The girl was probably experiencing some anxiety too - she didn't do what she did to hurt you, but to escape from a situation that was making her scared or uncomfortable partially stemming from her own mental baggage at least as much as from the date. This does NOT excuse her behaviour. I'm saying this to show you that she was also a very vulnerable person--you're not the only one who feels this way! It was not nice for her to leave you with the bill. It was also not nice for her to end the date in what sounds like a pretty abrupt manner. This is not normal dating behaviour and hopefully you won't experience that again anytime soon. I think that online dating is probably the most brutal way to date. Everybody's stressed out about dating, everyone has a different idea of how to behave, hetero men are overwhelmed constantly by competition, and hetero women are overwhelmed constantly by the volume of communication they receive from people whom they know nothing about. But. It gets you dates. You could sign up for an extra-curricular activity and actually meet people you already have something in common with, but this would not score you dates very frequently. Have you mentioned to family, friends, or co-workers that you are looking for a relationship? Maybe putting yourself out there in that way would result in a date or two with someone who has been pre-screened by someone you trust. It's hard, and there's no getting around it. You're actually already doing really well by having gone on some dates in the recent past. Someone really special is out there looking for you - good luck in finding her.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

I'm not sure how it'll work out in the long run, but I'm interested to see how I feel after a couple of months at the 50 mg level.

"I'm currently taking it for depression and anxiety. I've been on it for about 4 weeks now. The only things I've noticed since taking is that I don't oversleep as often and I'm losing weight, but it is still sort of early. I started at 25 mg for the first week, then 50 mg for three weeks. I just started taking 100 mg a few days ago. I'm keeping track of my moods, social activities, sleep patterns, and other stuff I think of that is relevant in a little spreadsheet I fill out daily. I got that idea from another user on this sub, and I highly recommend it. It will help you keep track of any progress (or bad side effects).",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

"The effects of psychiatric drugs are very individual, but for me at least it helped a LOT! I mean, I remember the exact moment when I first felt it's effects: standing at the bus-stop on my way to the shrink. Jobless, on welfare and with absolutely no hope left. Normally I would stand there trying to attract as little attention as possible, and just staring into the ground avoiding all eye-contact. Suddenly, on that special day, I kicked an empty beer can just for the fun of it, and realized I didn't give a shit about people looking over towards me. The whole world opened up to me and I was finally free to live again. SSRI's won't remove the anxiety, but they can mask the symptoms in such a degree that you can be a part of society. Which reminds me: I remember my shrink telling me that zoloft and other SSRI's work best (regarding SA) for people with *severe* social anxiety. Everyone feels some degree of SA. If this illness isn't crippling your life and you are perfectly able to function in society, but feel nervous before a presentation or something, then other drugs (or none) might be better.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

The odds of the preferences lining up and us getting along are very low, so I need to keep meeting new people in order to someday meet those I get along with.

"No one can answer this question, including yourself and the mental health professionals that are supporting you. My (subjective) advice is not to listen to your mom. Give the medicine a try. If it doesn't work, try a couple others until you find one that helps. I hate medicine, especially these trial and error adventures, but I've found one that helps. Within the first week, I felt really grounded and less detached. Try not to worry so much about whether it will help or not. It won't get any worse, in any case. Also, think about the answer you are looking for. Are you looking for someone to say the medicine will certainly help? or are you looking for someone to say it won't so you have an excuse not to take the medicine?

"I also used to often obsess about almost every social interaction. I guess what you have to do is recognise those thoughts; specifically what made it ‚Äòawkward‚Äô for you and reason with them. When I used to do that I realised I focused on the negative way too much, so much in fact that the thoughts were way too unreasonable and one sided towards negativity. I also realised the person doesn‚Äôt really care about me or what I do so much, they have their own life and to them anything I say or do wrong doesn‚Äôt really matter. What I did is counter those thoughts with more positive but more importantly neutral thoughts. Something like ‚ÄúWhen that girl spoke to me at the library I said something wrong or out of place that made it awkward BUT it doesn‚Äôt really matter because she wouldn‚Äôt think of me any less because of that small thing and besides probably the same happens to her too sometimes‚Äù. That‚Äôs it, and I would make this a conclusion to that situation and it would usually work in putting an end to thoughts about that. I also started to apply a higher standard to other people, kind of like I did to myself and started noticing that people aren‚Äôt perfect. They would often do or say the wrong thing quite a lot, the difference was that to them it wasn‚Äôt nearly as big of a deal as it was to me. They didn‚Äôt allow such a minor thing to become a problem, they would simply move on. I especially started noticing the same thing in people who I admired (famous great people or friends who were very social and had a big social circle).

"I understand exactly what you mean. I can say though I've learned a trick that keeps me from dwelling on my past conversations. The trick is I make a ""false"" excuse in my mind. It may sound odd, but it works. Most people, for example strangers, don't know I feel anxious in social situations. In my mind I may be freaking out, but my exterior doesn't always show it directly. To a stranger I may come off as shy, tired, bored, or meek when I am really only feeling anxious for a moment. I may say something odd or fumble. Whatever happens in that moment happens. Later on when I'm alone and begin to think about the situation, I stop myself if I start thinking something negative. I then flip my thought and make it false by thinking, ""Oh they don't know what my day was like. They don't know I haven't slept in two days."" Or, ""I have a huge date/party/event to attend tomorrow and they have no idea how I excited I am for it."" Neither occurred, but they are possible. The main point of flipping is to help yourself realize you're human. They're human. People, even people with SA, don't know when someone else has SA.

Once I went out for pizza with friends, and literally didn't get anything because the waiter forgot to ask me, and I was too afraid to correct him.

I'm 22 now, and still have many of the same problems, and I feel like my anxiety prevents me from getting help. The one good thing I have done, that has gotten rid of some of the smaller problems, has been forcing myself to undertake a degree that requires a lot of communication.

Many hospitals have a ""patient advocate"" on staff and you may call upon them to intercede on your behalf if you feel you are being discriminated against.

"I didn't get my license until I was 25 for the exact same reason. Almost a year later, I still can't drive on highways, but at least I can give myself a ride to work. What actually helped me was trying to think of it like a game. I thought about how there have been computer games I've been really intimidated anxious to play. What always helped me in those games was starting from the newbiest noob tutorial level and slowly making my way up in difficulty, incrementally adding new skills to try out, replaying the easiest parts over again if I had to, until eventually I knew the controls and mechanics of the game like a third hand. I realized it wasn't so much as simply experience than I needed (that was a given), but a safe place in which to practice, where errors could be made and corrected without causing too much stress. So I just thought of building my my driving skill in the same way I might build up experience in a game. I knew that my most taken route would be the one I take back and forth from work, so I thought of that as my tutorial course. I just drove that route over and over again until I got bored of it. Then thought of new places to go and added those routes to my set. Skills I needed to learn: Parking, changing lanes, making U-turns, etc. Those I would build up one at a time, easiest to most difficult, as I built up my confidence. I think the one thing to keep in mind is that while it's important to make progress, don't feel pressured to do something that *really* makes you feel uncomfortable and unsafe until you feel ready. As I was learning, I had people ""advise"" me to do stuff I didn't feel ready to attempt, but I was really adamant about dictating my own pace of progression, and boy I'm glad I did. It might take you longer than most people to accomplish, but I think that's the real problem that anxiety gives you. It isn't that it makes it impossible to do the things that come easy for most people, it just makes you have to work harder and longer to obtain it. Yes, some may ridicule you for that and make you feel like a loser for the fact that you actually have to put effort into it, like you said. Yes, its sucks and its unfair. But once you have it, its yours, and it'll be awesome, and that'll be all that matters.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"20 year old here, I don't know how I have my license... lol. Although I have one, I avoid driving as much as possible. I hate it.

"Wow. I was about to submit a new post just to write this exact problem that I have. I can't begin to tell you how much I relate to everything you wrote. I will be turning 20 in April. I don't have my license either and it's very distressing to me. The issue is that I don't even know my way around the neighborhood. I'm too afraid to learn how to use public transportation because I don't know how, despite living in a city. I am practically sheltered in my room all day. I attend distant learning college at a top tier state university so that's all I do. It's depressing me to write further.

"Hi, I just came across your post kind of randomly so I know this reply is late. I do not really have SA, BUT I had the same problem and I didn't get my license until I was 19... most people get their license at 16. I failed my drivers test about 3 times at one building and went to another place and finally passed. I told the driving instructor that I needed my license as I was moving out of the country (it was true) and she kind of took pity on me and understood I needed to get it ASAP. It might also help to try to get your license in a small town where the line is not very long and they might be more lenient. The people at the first place were unforgiving, but the lady at the second was amazingly supportive. Remember that they see so many faces everyday they wont remember yours by the end of the week. Before you take your driver's license test try to drive around the area where you know or think they will be testing you. I took someone I trusted with me and they talked me through the route like ""stop here"". I rehearsed driving the route and general area so that I would know what was coming up. For the next few years or so I had problems getting places because if I did not already know the route I was scared. So I asked someone I trusted to go with me and eventually I began to learn how to get around my city. To this day I still have problems going places that are far away and not easy to get to, especially if the route is complicated and involves a lot of freeways or traffic. I will not even drive into the big city downtown area AT ALL because the few times I've tried have been nervewracking. But If I had to I think I could eventually. Once things become familiar and you start trying to travel farther and farther each time it gets easier. Go one more intersection down and then back up the way you came. Always keep a GPS as backup. Buy AAA insurance which will tow you incase of an accident. Remember that cars are EXPENSIVE and although it will take getting used to crazy drivers no one WANTS to get into an accident and cause anyone harm, especially because that will cost them money. Also when you are learning find someone very supportive who will not criticize you. Find an abandoned parking lot and just try driving between the rows then add on things once you become more comfortable with it. Godspeed.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"I'm scared of driving too, but almost everyone has gotten their license. No need for small talk. Either an instructor is teaching you, or grading you.

"I got my learners licence (the written test) at 18 and after over a year of waiting and private lessons finally went for my new drivers licence. It took me 4 times to pass and I hated every minute of it. I feel uncomfortable having someone judging my driving and not having music playing when I drive. I refuse to go for my full licence for the same reason, luckily I'm not really restricted with the licence I currently have so I'm ok with that although I feel like I constantly get judged for being an N driver.

"This may sound a bit weird, and it will be long, but I'm someone older than you with AvPD. Hopefully I can share something with you. One of the odd things I struggled with was a weird combination of feeling out of place but also having really low self esteem. So, for example, I'd think, ""I just don't fit in this world, none of this makes any sense."" But then I'd think, ""you egotistical maniac, what are the odds that YOU are somehow some unique, enlightened person that sees the world differently from everybody else?"" So I'd go back to viewing myself as flawed and lament how I just wasn't somehow successfully achieving what everybody else had. But then I started looking into philosophy, and I realized that people accepted as brilliant thinkers sometimes had wildly ""weird"" views of the world. I've actually become more of a rational/scientific guy than a vague philosophy guy, but the point is, I realized that unique world views have inherent value. They are not less valuable than commonly-held world views. They may be less practical or something, but they're not ""worse."" So what I ultimately realized is that I may not feel like I fit in with the various ways other people fit in. I'm not religious, I don't care about having prestige, etc. Other people seem to get fulfillment from various things that just don't click with me. But what I concluded was that I don't have a right to say there's NOTHING out there for me and NO way to ""fit in"" unless I've essentially learned everything about everything. I know that sounds a bit crazy. A person cannot possibly learn ""everything."" But what I mean is, just because you don't fit in to the way 99% of other people seem to, the Earth's population is 7 billion. That means that if there's just 1% of the population you share a mindset or world view with, that's 70 million people. That's more people than live in France or England. Or view it another way. (I don't meant this in a judgmental way, so hopefully I can say it clearly.) Imagine you're a 14 year old lesbian atheist currently living in Afghanistan or something. But you've had no exposure whatsoever to western thought. You're sure as hell going to have ""avoidant personality disorder."" You don't feel like you measure up to almost ANY of the social expectations, there's a huge disconnect between what you actually feel like and what you think you're ""supposed"" to feel like, etc. But from our perspective, we wouldn't look at that person and say, ""what a weirdo"" or ""what a failure."" We'd say, ""man, she was really born in the wrong place at the wrong time."" We wouldn't assign any blame to her or somehow consider her ""less than."" So try to turn your view around a bit. Yes, you're isolated and ""screwed up."" But you live in the best possible time to be that way and you're actually lucky in a lot of ways. Why? Because you can easily access just about all of the information in the world. You can listen to podcasts that just generally teach you about our universe. You can browse Wikipedia until you find something that actually makes you think ""whoa, this is cool."" You have avoidant personality disorder. But try to consider that what you want to avoid is the environment in which you are currently living. And you had very little say in how that environment was shaped. So what you have to focus on controlling is what your future environments will look like. So I'll just conclude with my own example and perhaps that will give you some hope. After I learned about philosophy, it made me realize that people think about things in unique ways and that's ok. That made me start to wonder why people thought about things the way they did. That made me start to wonder about the brain. That led me to read books about neuroscience and how the brain worked. That led me to understand that the way almost everybody on Earth understands themselves is flawed (or at least incomplete). That led me to finally truly feel like, ""wait a second, we're all just essentially really complicated computers, and while it would certainly be easier if I were running on Windows or Mac OS like most people, there's nothing 'wrong' with running on Linux."" And then when you reach that conclusion, you find it a lot easier to interact with other people because you don't have the same frustrations of not being able to ""connect"" with them. You even find other ""Linux users."" I know I've rambled. I apologize for that. Certainly what I said may not apply specifically to you. But that's the point. It shouldn't have to. There is some context in which you fit just fine. Maybe you ARE best suited to be a hermit somewhere. But if that idea is scary or frustrating to you, then chances are that isn't your ""destiny."" You just need to have a better knowledge of all the contexts in which you could possibly fit. Listen to lots of podcasts. Read lots of books. Take lots of interesting courses. Browse the farthest corners of the internet. You're not allowed to say that ""nothing"" gets you fired up and excited until you've explored EVERYTHING. The good news about that is that it is literally impossible to reach the end of that journey without finding something that clicks with you. I can promise you that somewhere along the way you'll meet someone or stumble across something that makes you think ""wow, this is IT."" And even if you don't, you will have found significant meaning in your life as the most well-read human being on the planet! We're all specks in infinity. In the grand scheme of things, we started walking upright yesterday, and we went from electricity to the internet in the last two seconds. Of course there will be people like you who look around and go, ""I don't know what the hell to make of all of this."" Learn a lot. It will make you interesting. When you're interesting, you'll want to meet other interesting people because you'll be hungry to consume more interestingness. And interesting people like interesting people, so interesting people will like you. Next thing you know you'll have interesting friends and an interesting life. You might never feel ""normal."" But my guess is the more ""normal"" somebody is, the more they wish something interesting would happen in their life. (Disclaimer: I'm not arguing that being ""different"" is somehow better than fitting in. But I'm also not arguing the opposite. Some people click with the majority of the world and some don't. da Vinci was a great man, so was the anonymous factory worker who took care of his family and said ""please"" and ""thank you."" My only point is that feeling weird and out of place only means you haven't found the context in which you feel comfortable. So seek that out.)",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"Actually yes, a while ago I had just moved high schools and was going through the whole new guy thing. I had pretty crippling SA at the time, but I managed to talk to some dude in my class I thought was pretty cool and he invited me to join him with some of his other friends at lunch, I never showed up and instead hung around with a bunch of sport jerks, instead. A real bunch of boring, slightly jerkish average guys. I tried to figure out why I didn't just go hang out with that other crowd. and i realised it come down to self worth. I didn't think myself worthy of hanging with that group. Instead il hang with these jerks that I don't care about, because even if our friendship fails, it's not like I lost anything valuable right? I don't have to deal with any anxiety with these guys because they are on my level, the level I deserve. Anyway, that's my thinking about what can cause this: Ones self worth can come into play.

"You worry about your own demeanor (that the right word?) which is normal, okay, your being harsh about yourself.

Best would be to bring it up the next time, make an excuse ""i had a crappy day that time."" etc. BUT this idea likely scares you just as much. You know what? That's okay. Your just not at that point yet because you have an illness named: social anxiety. You (and me too) have a much harder time to be 'responsible adults' about this stuff and we worry enough about this. But let's look at from that other guys perspective. He (most likely) does not have SA, so if he did feel ignored he could have spoken up about it (that's what socially well-adjusted people probably do, right?) Since he did not, he either didn't care enough about it, was busy, or isn't as socially well-adjusted as you think.

"I'm not sure I can say anything that can help, because this is basically going to be a variant of the ""just do it"" advice that we've all heard a thousand times. I know it's not that simple, but as far as I'm aware ""exposure therapy"" is pretty much the only way to successfully deal with SA. This sounds like a great opportunity for you. Not just professionally, but also for maybe overcoming your SA. You say you're already pretty much running the warehouse. You seem fairly confident that you're good at it. If you're going to take steps to combat your SA, it makes sense to do it in an area of your life where you already have some confidence. Avoidance is a core part of SA. We tend to make excuses to avoid social interaction. If it's your job, it may no longer be possible\* to do that. You'll be forced out of your comfort zone. That may be scary, but I think it's ultimately a good thing because it's a step towards overcoming SA. I assume that running the warehouse now involves managing other warehouse employees, so isn't that job also forcing you to interact with people? And you're good at it! I think you'll find that the same will happen when you're in your promoted job. I don't know if this will help. And I don't know if this job will help you overcome SA in general. I too am relatively confident in my job, and while I still get anxious there when I have to give presentations or meet people, it's way better than in less professional contexts. For me it doesn't seem to really carry over to other aspects of my life, but I get the feeling that for a lot of people confidence in one area of their life does carry over to other areas. But even if it doesn't, it's good to have the one area where things aren't so bad. \* Of course it will still be technically possible to make excuses and avoid social interaction, but I think it's a trade off.

There are really two ways this could go with her. The first one is that she actually has feelings for you. In this scenario, if she's willing to leave him for you then congratulations, you've got a woman you can't trust not to leave you when the relationship settles and someone new comes along. You will lose your best friend and any mutual friends the two of you have. My brother's wife left him for one of his friends. It lasted with the friend for a few years before she left him for yet another guy. Fortunately she and my brother had no kids but she and the friend had one. Now he's a single dad. A cheater is a cheater is a cheater. Scenario two is the more likely one. Marriages settle, the flirty romance dies away when people get comfortable. So she flirts with you a little bit, smiles too big, looks too long, because you eat it up and she feels desirable again. She is using you to feed her ego. It is completely unfair to you.

If she is upset and needs support she should be getting it from her husband or her girl friends, definitely not with another man with whom she is generating chemistry.

"When we wash a glass, we do so because we understand the dirt and glass are separable. We think about this glass not as being dirty, but as having dirt. If the glass were dirty by nature, we would throw it out, as the dirt and glass would be inseparable. But this is not the case. There is only dirt on an otherwise pure glass. We must not perceive ourselves as inherently ignorant, hateful, jealous, or greedy. These are just dirt particles. Know that you can cleanse yourself of these, just as the glass that comes out sparkling from the dishwasher. And better yet, in our cases, there isn't even real dirt. There is only the construct of dirt; the illusion of dirt we trick ourselves into seeing and believing. I do not suffer from anger issues, so I can't not relate. That being said, I have been angry, and I can understand. I won't pretend to know absolute wisdom in solving every anger issue, but I do believe the first step is in revamping how we view our emotions. Instead of viewing the situation as ""I am angry"", instead, try viewing the situation as ""there is anger"". You are not the dirt specs, you are the glass, capable of being washed. Do not relate to the anger, simply observe it. Even this simple step can help you not act on the anger.

Only....it's been over a month since they've called and I'm at a point now where I'm doubtful they'll ever call at all. Back in high school I took the difficult step of seeking help and this very situation occurred...and they never did end up calling me. They just...forgot about me it seems. It was difficult to take in but I knew that I was just one of 500 million people suffering with exactly the same problem and this probably happened to a lot of other people. :( I don't know if I'll ever get help from a therapist but this experience has finally taught me that in the end, the only true strength you have is the strength you find on your own. Getting help can only be an element, once you decide to lean on it completely your chances of getting better drop significantly. This rings even more true when you consider the fact that a lot of those mental health professionals probably don't know what it's like to have depression. After all, they made it through medical school and got some decent jobs, a very rare accomplishment for someone who lives with depression. I know, I've had several careers ruined by it.

"To be fair, ECT is not at all ground breaking. It has been around for quite a long time. The two different types of [ECT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy) are unilateral and bilateral, which refer to where the attached electrodes are placed on the patient's head thus changing the flow of electricity. My guess is that we are nowhere near the necessary level of understanding of the human brain that would be required to be selective about what memories the patient would want erased. Speaking from experience, the memory loss I had during ECT consisted of the entire year before, as well as several months after (I had a very hard time with short term memory, and forming longer term memories). For me, ECT was not worth it. I had sore muscles after treatments, severe headaches, memory loss, and in the end I was still depressed/suicidal.

"There are many ways to remedy this situation. Anti-depressant + therapy would be a start for depression but may make her appetite increase subsequently eliciting an increase in bulimic activity, if her self-image does not improve. To counter-act the bulimia, if therapy fails, there is an approach you might be interested in, but it is dangerous and causes esophageal harm, not to mention trust issues. Basically you would incorporate peppers (jalapeno, chili, ect.) into both your diets thereby inflicting much pain when it is vomited back up. The negative reinforcement may dissuade her from practicing bulimia after a few times unless she uses the physical pain to escape her emotional pain. As for anorexia, try weed unless she suffers from an organic mental illness. Always encourage exercise, it is possible to swap addictions from purging to sweating especially is self-image is the main motivator. It seems like the ex created or exacerbated emotional anxiety that she combated by starving/purging. You can explain this to her all day long but she will probably only listen to a professional.

"My PTSD is combined with Borderline, so it's a bit different. However, a lot of the coping strategies are similar. Besides therapy, which was already discussed, here's something super easy you can do that's cheap/free. Stimulate your senses with good things. When you're surrounded by things that make you feel calm and happy, it helps you deal with your emotional trauma. Try investing in a candle, room spray, body wash, anything that has a scent that's very calming for you. Lavender is known for having calming qualities. Sure, it might seem feminine, but if you like the scent, who cares. Cinnamon is also a good one. Of course, you know what you like best, so explore that. Having something to fidget with is nice. Whether it's a tiny little soft stuffed animal to pet, or a smooth chain you can twirl, or something with a weird texture. It helps take your mind off your emotions and gives you something to physically focus on. Hang a poster of a beautiful place, or throw up a strand of christmas lights. Get a super cool looking mug for your morning coffee. Hell, even wearing a colourful pair of socks gives you something to look at that's different, and that helps your mind focus on stuff other than how depressed/anxious you are. Find some good instrumental music. It's easy to get lost in lyrics, but a lot of times you can focus too much on what's being said, and that's not always a good thing when you're depressed. I personally have found Irish/Celtic instrumental music to be super helpful. Not only is it beautiful, but it's a lot of fun and can help your mood. I know it all seems silly, but those tricks have helped me a lot. And it's a lot cheaper than therapy. =) (Not saying you don't need therapy, because it is very helpful, but I know it's expensive and you can't have it every day.

"As I don't know if you have a therapist I'll try to cover what I've learnt from my own experiences: Get a therapist (cognitive, definitely not a psychoanalyst in your case). Stop drinking coffe and any caffeinated drinks (anything but herbal teas, coke/pepsi, energy drinks). Staying away from drugs and alcohol should be a no-brainer. Start working out if you're not already. This should lower both your anxiety levels as well as improving the quality of your sleep. It's the endorphins you're after, so long workouts are best. 45 mins 3 times a week of continuous running/fast walking for instance. It's hard to give anything more detailed without knowing your physical condition, but most gyms will offer to make a workout suited to you at a reasonable price. Different types of meditation could also be an idea. ACEM-meditation is a non-religious method that has been proven to reduce stress levels as well as improve sleep quality. I'd have a look at their homepage to see if they have any instructors in your area: http://www.acem.com/acem_sites/acem_com/the_organization The more classical schools tend to focus on concentration and exploration of the mind and/or religious ideas. While I'd recommend ACEM for you, there are some tricks regarding concentration that can be helpful during an actual anxiety attack. It is possible to block out what's in your mind and only experience the physical symptoms. I do this by focusing intently on a small piece of a melody or any constant source of sound that can distract me (a mantra of sorts I guess). You also want to try to relax as much as possible while doing this. Slow down your breathing as much as possible at the onset of an attack and try to find something to occupy your mind. Your mind is trying to rationalize an irrational fear which is why things around you or in your mind can appear to be the cause (they're not of course). Try to maintain a sound sleep schedule. Looking into other causes of bad sleep with a physician could be a good idea. Also be aware that some physicians tend to prescribe medication out of the blue. Without me being qualified in any way to comment on this, mine said you'd want to avoid that for younger people as much as possible. I'd discuss it with a therapist (psychologist) and ideally a specialist (psychiatrist) over a general practitioner if it comes to that. edit: Make sure your don't go around hungry. Low blood sugar heightens the risk of anxiety attacks. Don't eat big meals before you go to bed, but make sure you don't go to bed hungry.

It's a very tough skill. But I really suggest you try it. Force yourself to go out, because might actually have a good time. Remember that, so next time you want to turn down an invitation, gather your energy and willpower and say yes. I hope this helped!",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"Go, if only to get yourself out of the habit of talking yourself out of going places with people. If you tell yourself that you're just waiting for a better time when you feel less tired, less exhausted, more enthusiastic, more social, then you're never going to do it. Because the fact is that you're almost always going to feel a little exhausted, anxious and awkward by the very idea of going out with people, even when you know you'll like it. Get out of the habit of saying no because of what you're feeling, and get into the habit of saying yes *despite* what you're feeling. Realize that your feelings are lying to you. Your feelings want you to stay home in a familiar and safe place to be lonely and miserable. Your feelings want to take your right to have fun away from you and convince you that you were never worthy enough to deserve it in the first place. If you *know* you want to go out, and you know that at the end of it you will come away having had a good time, but your feelings are telling you to stay home and that it's not worth the effort, all the more reason you should defy what those stomach butterflies are telling you and go!",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

"The simplest solution is to cut those dicks out of your life. If they're actively going out of their respective ways to make you angry or put you down, you have every right to get angry. Delete them from the social media that you're on and phase them out of your life. If it's not that simple, slowly wean yourself off of those pricks and make some new friends who think more like you do. Be around people that think like you do, who you can speak openly with about whatever it is you feel like. You'll find those instances in which you start to seethe will fewer and far between. And even then, the best thing to do is to be vocal to people who will be receptive to your negative emotions, people who will actually listen to you. Don't let it boil over and leave you silently angry. Best of luck.",2014,Anger,1,0
"I am really bad at this too, but a great piece of advice I was given in the past that has helped is to remember past conversations with the individual you were speaking with and followup in a future conversation you're having. It's a bit awkward at first, but people love to talk about themselves so it can be natural once you get good at it. For example, my boss is taking a course so once or twice a month I will ask her how her course is doing, if she has any upcoming tests, etc. I might tell her a story about my college days if I can think of anything (eg. the time I had to take my exams with an abcessed tooth) to contribute to the conversation. It can get stale after awhile if you constantly revisit the same topics, but if you keep noting to yourself things that people discuss it really does help break the monotony. Obviously you will need to practise a bit of tact when coming up with topics to discuss, if you constantly pry into someone's personal life it can feel violating, but if you just remember to keep it light and limit yourself to somewhat trivial things, like extracurricular activities, shows they like, etc. you should be fine. Another way is to just bring up something you're interested in and see if they bite. This method doesn't work for me as I generally work with an older generation of people than me. I work with older, not too hip men and I like knitting, crafts, TV shows, technology, and geeky things, so me saying ""Did you see the latest walking dead?!"" generally leads to some blank stares and ""is that a movie or a tv show?"" but it might work for you and as a plus, you might end up having conversations that actually interest you. Hope this sort of rambling block of text gives you something to try next time you have to make small talk :)",2014,socialanxiety,1,0

"I've been thinking about the same thing lately. Currently I go to therapy once a week to work on my issues, and one of them is anger and negative thinking. I've begun emphasizing this matter to my therapist--that, now that it's been established I have anger problems, exactly *what* can I do to control it/prevent it/deal with it? Everything seems to center around the whole ""let go of the anger"" thing. (That phrase drives me bananas, by the way. If anyone *could* just 'let go', wouldn't we have done it by now?) Anyway~ it seems that a big part of it is finding ways to avoid becoming angry *before* you even get into a situation that would trigger it. This has to do with getting to a good, firm, mental place where you feel comfortable, safe, stable, NOT vulnerable (that's important), and ready to commit to not being angry. This includes, whenever possible, avoiding situations that you know will be very hard to deal with. It's good that you recognize that alcohol makes it easier to get angry: you can anticipate that in situations (e.g. family gatherings, sports events, whatever) where you may encounter personal stressors, you should avoid drinking. Just be careful of internalizing. (or ""pushing it down"") I did that for years in my youth and it ended up creating a much more compounded type of anger. One thing I've found that *does* help me is to find something to laugh at in the situation. With driving, for example: every time someone does something crazy on the road, I picture scenes from movies where the actors go absolutely ape shit over traffic jams. If anyone else in the car is angered by the situation as well, I'll sometimes quote it aloud to see if I can get a laugh out of them as well. While it doesn't completely alleviate the anger, it seems to break the little pulsing ball of fury to smaller, easier to handle pieces. Hope I didn't bore you too bad. Just wanting to share some thoughts~ Good luck",2014,Anger,1,0

"This happens a lot with the first time you find out someone likes you. With social anxiety some experience occur later. This happens to some middle school or highschool kids, but with social anxiety you may not have been in a position to know someone likes you. So what I'm saying is it's normal to think you like someone when they like you. Social anxiety often leads to low self esteem and knowing someone like you and would want to be with you can be a huge self esteem boost. It makes you want to be around them more, you want to keep getting good. It may turn out with time you may like him, but from what I am inferring you like the idea of someone liking you.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"I haven't dealt with that exactly, but I used to fall for any woman who would take the time to talk to me despite my anxiety and shyness, or displayed interest in me. Like mich1331 said, I think it was related to low self esteem. It sounds like you are good friends with him. That's really valuable in itself! I wouldn't push anything farther, but just see if anything develops (especially if you feel like you're settling!). I hate to hear that someone would settle because of their SA. It's difficult, but it comes with other positive character traits and thoughtful people can see that. I know it doesn't seem like it, but with work and time you will be able to talk to someone who you have romantic feelings for. You sound very mature and intelligent. Source: Social anxiety growing up and gradually becoming less anxious (27 now). I definitely missed opportunities for dating because I couldn't talk to people or was afraid, and I've never had a girlfriend. I'm glad I haven't settled though because that would be bad for my self esteem and I could miss out on a real good relationship. But value your close friendships, they don't come often and tend to slip away with time.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"My only advice is to never enter a relationship in which you feel that you are having to ""settle"" for someone. It just won't go well. Once in my life I was in a similar boat that you were. I have social anxiety, very few boyfriends over my lifetime. I am also the proverbial Amy Farrah Fowler/Sheldon Cooper...more involved with science and my studies to really care about other things. So about 10 years ago when the opportunity came up to have a boyfriend, I went for it because ""when am I ever going to have another opportunity"". It was awful. I was in a fairly long relationship with him, but it never felt complete. He was nice, we had fun times, there was nothing wrong with him, I just don't think we were ever ultimately compatible. The ending of that relationship was one of the greatest things that could have happened in my life (I remember driving in my car shouting ""Freedom! Freedom!""). I am still focused on my current studies, and after that relationship in particular I now know what I want and don't want in a prospective partner (dating is always good for finding what you do and don't like). I'm still enjoying my freedom though. Maybe the right guy will come along, maybe he won't. (Honestly I'm not even looking right now. I wouldn't mind finding someone if the right guy came along, but I also don't mind being single at all). But what I have learned is not to settle to satisfy a social norm of being in a relationship.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"Like the others have said, it's important to make sure that you're not just talking yourself into liking someone because they're paying attention to you. This happens to me all the time; in fact I go through a phase of developing a mini-crush on basically any girl I start to get close with. But I've gotten a lot better at stepping back, taking a logical look at things, and seeing that we're probably not compatible enough for a romantic relationship. Just the fact that you're this apprehensive about him already tells me that your romantic prospects don't look so good. And besides, having a significant other won't heal your loneliness as much as you might think. I know what it's like to be a latecomer to relationships and just want that validation that *someone* out there likes you in that way. But if you don't have the self-esteem to back it up, that validation can feel surprisingly empty. Work on developing yourself, then on developing your friendships, then on developing a romantic relationship. You'll find that the last two just kinda happen on their own if you have the first part.",2014,socialanxiety,1,0
"I, too, would start to like any guy who showed an interest in me. I have definitely gone through the same thought-process as you...wondering if I really like him or if I only like him because he likes me (or if I'm settling).

I am 26 now and finally found my ""one"". It sucks that we are like this (with the social anxiety and all) but I am so so happy to see that I am not the only one who goes through this.

Anxiety is natural and necessary for survival. Some of us have developed a condition where ""Fight or Flight"" has a glitch and goes off when not needed. The rest of the brain tries to compensate by conjuring up these horrible images and situations to justify why it's in this sudden ""Fight or Flight"" state. Tell yourself, ""I'm. Not. Dying.

"Hey there, I get panic attacks too. They started out of the blue back probably in spring and they absolutely suck. I've gotten a lot better at managing them and they are getting less and less. They take time to fade away. The best things that helped me were to first and foremost see a therapist for panic. They can help you with something called CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) which is basically ways to talk yourself down when you are having an attack and to learn to prevent them. There may be certain triggers happening that you aren't even aware of right now. A medical doctor is just that - they are there to rule out anything physically wrong with you and they will immediately jump to medication. It sounds like you don't want that (like me) - you need a doctor who specializes in healing your thoughts. The second thing is to cut out foods and such that can make panic worse. These are things like caffeine, alcohol, energy drinks, pot... things that mimic panic in your body are often times a trigger. Make sure that you are staying well hydrated, sleeping enough, and eating healthy. Also you might like to check out /r/anxiety - a lot of great people on there who have been dealing with everything you are describing now. Try to remember that as much as panic sucks... it is one of the easier anxiety disorders to treat. It's all about learning what your brain is telling your body in certain situations. In the mean time, some things you can do (other than eating, drinking, and sleeping right) is to start a journal or a log. Whenever you get a panic attack go ahead and write down what you were just doing - where you are, who you are around, what you may have eaten. Now write down things that you are thinking - what are you telling yourself? Really think about it and be honest... In a panic attack it's likely all negative things. Things like ""I'm dying"" or ""I'm having a heart attack"". Now try to think of some positive thoughts to counter that - rational thoughts. For instance, if you tell yourself ""I'm having a heart attack""... you can counter that with ""My pulse is racing. If I was having a heart attack my pulse would not be racing."" Other things you can do in the midst of an attack to help pull yourself out is: - Stretching: Stretch your arms and chest muscles and really open this area up. Focus on the sensations of tension and release. - Hold something very cold like an ice pack. - Play catch with someone or toss a ball against the wall - it's hard to be trapped in your mind with thoughts if you have to focus on catching so you don't get hit in the face. - Do some pushups or lunges and really focus and count out what you are doing. - Eventually you will learn to work up to the idea that fighting against a panic attack is what fuels it. You have to learn to let go and accept it - to let it wash over you and just wait it out. This is what prevents one when you feel one coming on. I know it sounds counter productive, but it really works. Panic attacks are pure fear. If you take away that fear it has nothing to stand on.

"Hello :) I'm sorry to hear what you are experiencing. I have been experiencing panic attacks in the past and I am pleased to say that I haven't had one for months but I was pretty terrified when it started. I felt like I was dying and that scared me but my thoughts were so negative that I wanted to end my life. Panics varied in time and some left me insecure for hours. It took me time to be able to manage them so please don't feel discouraged if it's a long process. I was put on meds, got CBT and behavioural therapy. Not sure which helped most to be honest but below I will write down what I believe were the keys to my success. - Medication helped to reduce my general anxiety which then helped me to understand what was happening to me - The first step for me was to learn to accept panic attacks and how they made me feel - this helped me feel more in control - Then I tried the techniques. What helped me was writing my thoughts down because that helped me rationalise them. Counting slowly helped to break the cycle. Trying to cuddle myself, hold someones hand or a cushion to feel safe, taking slow deep breaths. Saying stories in my head about anything - anything to break the cycle. - Over time the techniques became easier to use and more effective resulting in shorter panic attacks so I started writing down potential triggers and symptoms before the panic attacks as I started noticing them - I began analysing all the things I've been writing down and my triggers started to became irrational to me and no longer caused panic attacks - this step was much easier to do with a therapist or a psychologist as they helped me put all the puzzle pieces together to help me understand my emotions which I then manage. I hope this helps and I wish you good luck x",2014,mentalhealth,1,0
"The hospital is a safe place where you can't hurt yourself, but if you go in for suicidal ideation, you won't really be receiving one-on-one therapy. You could be in anywhere from 3 to 7 days, but there are longer term inpatient programs designed for borderline personality patients at some facilities that do involve therapy. The best way to go about it is to have your doctor call around at local facilities and find out if a bed is available at a place with a good reputation. But, if you can just find a therapist on short notice who has experience with your diagnosis, this would be the best option. Do you have close friends or family members you can stay with or who can visit with you in the meantime? The point of finding therapy asap or going to the hospital, whichever you end up doing, is to stay physically safe. If you can accomplish this without 24/7 medical supervision, it's cheaper and might prevent you from dealing with the trauma of being in the hospital (also, you won't miss as much school/work). P.S. Antidepressants tend to make me ultra suicidal. Perhaps you could get your doctor to offer some alternatives and find out if the problem isn't the dosage but maybe the type of medication.

They adjusted my meds and made sure I was stable on them before they'd even consider ""letting"" me go home. I'm pretty sure I could have really checked out at any time I wanted. I had daily short appointments with case workers, doctors, and other psychological workers the whole time, but not ""therapy"" per se; this was just to get me back on my feet until I was safe at home and back in my own team's care. We, as patients, received visitors and read, played board games, and watched tv to pass time when there weren't ""coping skills workshops.""

It has been shown to work really well for types of anxiety and depression. Also, you would probably only need weekly sessions, and I know it can still be pricey, but totally worth it in the long run because CBT focuses on teaching you methods so that you won't need them long term.

"Im a psychology major and have also suffered from the illness, which led me to study it intensely, so maybe I can she some light on your question. Genetically depression does seem to run in families, however, the gene for depression hasnt been found and any claims for it seem to sketchy at the very least. Biologically, Depression is linked to deficiencies in three major neuro transmittors and an increase in one. Neuroepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine are low in a depressed persons body, while cortisol is high. While the first three are usually targeted by medication, cortisol is the key to your question. Increased cortisol usally equates with increased stress. Chronic stress even more so, which from an survival point of view means you need to escape the stress and the best way is to withdraw. The result is a depressive state, also the increased cortisol damages brain cells especially in the emotional region of the brain (amygdala) resulting in a further increase of the depressive state, increased anxiety, unstable mood, lack of pleasure. So its essentially a survival mechanism that is overreacting and has gone haywire, similar to allergies resulting from an overreaction of the immune system. However, it can also be a learned helplessness as a result of abuse, bullying, constant problems in life or a bad family enviroment. But this also results in the previously mentioned changes. This is very simplistic and undetailed but I hope it helps.",2014,depression,1,0

"I'm continuing with a long running campaign to improve my life. Depression and generalized anxiety basically crippled me, and for the past 7 years (from 15 to 22) I've been a complete bum and done nothing with my life. Never had a job, never had any really close friends, didn't even graduate from high school. I did go to community college, but I didn't really have any direction and was basically just taking classes because my mom was forcing me to. I didn't even have a driver's license because of my anxiety. My life was just going to school a few days a week and staying at home sitting on the computer the rest of the time. Around May 2013 I decided to try and kick myself into shape. I've managed to make a huge amount of progress. * Reconnected with my father after 10 years of complete silence. * Had my first two job interviews (still no job, but I'm dramatically closer) * Finally got a driver's license! Drive every day now! * Moved out of my grandmother's house where I allowed to laze around and do nothing and moved in with my mother which has forced me to start being more productive * Learned how to cook! Went from having all of my meals made for me to making all of my meals myself. * Going to school full time with a clear goal. * Volunteering every week for an organization that I really love! * Slowly becoming more self confident. This past school semester was the most social I've ever been able to be. Still haven't made any friends, but I definitely will be able to next semester. * I've also lost 20lbs! I'm only 40lbs away from my ideal weight now. None of this might seem very amazing to some people, but to me all of these things are extremely dramatic improvements. It hasn't been easy (my depression has actually gotten worse since I moved) but I'm planning to keep forcing through and work on improving myself even more through the next year.

Same deal with people at work (school) - I don't think I'm disliked but pretty much ignored. My conversations are awkward and I think some people vaguely like me but don't go to the effort to talk to me. No one's definitely ever called me to just to talk either, haha, although I did have some good friends in the past. Anyway, I hope you feel better. I'm sure you've heard this all before but anyway: the hopelessness is just in our minds.

But sometimes I realize that 27 is still pretty young and a lot can change. My grandfather got (re)married in his 70s! I think as we get older being stable becomes more important than being experienced or outgoing anyway. Just have to figure out how to get out enough to meet people. Try therapy if you don't do it already. Other things: I just signed up for internet dating even though I have no good pictures of myself and I don't know how to get a date let alone form a relationship. Still some women seem interested.

Others need a little bit of support from friends and family. But the rest require a lot of determination and professional help (Therapy, medication, etc.). I have had a pretty crazy set of life changing events happen to me over the past 5 years that have led me down a deeper path of anxiety related issues and problems with isolation/avoidence. Therapy does help quite a bit but it's definely not a quick fix. I went the Therapy for a little bit and took me about 2 months to realize the first therapist was not helping at all. Then I was able to find one that I liked talking to. They were very helpful with explaining things you can't see in yourself (not criticism, just observations). And it really helped just talking about things you don't understand and explaining how psychology is relevant to society, how people's minds work and how social interaction is quite complicated by nature. For me just talking was starting to become therapeutic, I would make jokes about how I was paying them just to be my friend. Unfortunately i never got to a point where I was able to apply the suggestions/techniques I could use to overcome my lack of confidence, anxities and general confusion about where I stood in the world.

"Personally, I'm against the idea that we need our parents to validate our lives and our choices. How we think of our parents is an extension of our personalities. The feeling that we need our parents could be addicting, and eventually can destroy us. You can rebuild yourself and you can reflect and work on yourself. People can call you sick, unhappy, all sorts of nasty things, but they will never have emotional power over you. You are the strongest person for yourself and you are the cure. I wish you the best of luck with your life. May every day be another beginning of a new age in your life, just like today is the beginning of a new year.",2015,depression,1,0

"Therapy gets mentioned because it can really help people just to talk about their problems. It can't cure your problems unless you put some effort into fixing things yourself, but therapy (and medication if you need it) can make things easier to getting to the point where you feel comfortable in life. As for how you can get help, you just have to force yourself to trust someone. It can be hard as hell, but if you're able to do it and it's the right person then it'll open up new doors for you. I think if you can force yourself to trust a therapist then it might help some.",2015,depression,1,0
"Quick side note: love the username Wow, it is remarkable how much this resembles my life and outlook on the world. The constant suffering, wanting it all to end without hurting loved ones. Lack of Motivation. The waiting for the world to bring in the next wave of pain. I am 22 and am barely starting this similar journey ( at least I assume in comparison to you who stated this has been going on for a decade ) and have a chemical imbalance as well (bipolar 2). First off, as painful as it may seem, your life isn't a series of unfortunate events. It is only life, just like everyone else's. Everyone has their own invisible battle that they are wagging. You are just struggling with yours. Depression is like a magnifying glass, making you feel emotions much more intensely to the point of it debilitating you. I'm not trying invalidate your life experiences, but I do want to bring to your attention that no ones life is easy. Some scars are easier to see than others. Pain is unavoidable. But happiness is always within reach. Just remember its in YOUR hands how you deal with it. Everyone has their life and their path might sometimes mess with yours. No one is going to perfectly fit with yours so just buckle down and find a better way to cope with pain. Here is something that changed my outlook upside down. I know it may be corny or w.e. but hear me out. Happiness is not a goal line you pass. It's not a point you reach, a gift given, or a lucky draw. Happiness is something created. You create your own happiness and it should be shared with those around you. Understand that bad things are unavoidable and never have good timing (a little john mayer for you). You have to check yourself when these feelings arise. Remind yourself, its the depression, not me. Its difficult. Very difficult. But baby steps. Look for the little things that makes you happy. Your mothers smile, a funny laugh from a coworker, or the crunch of the first bite of cereal in the morning. I'm with you, I'm so tired of everything already. I go to sleep and pray that I won't wake up. But hang in there. Don't give up.",2015,depression,1,0

A good therapist can help you look at yourself in a new perspective, to help you discover connections you haven't noticed before, provide explanations and help you with difficult choices, to be an ear to vent your feelings, thoughts and frustrations to without judgement. You can put all of those things to use. In time, they do become like a friend, a very smart and insightful one, at least my therapist has. Do keep in mind that it is VERY important to find a good and qualified specialist who has a personality that meshes with yours.

"Hey ArabianDisco. I'm a tad tipsy, so I apologize if anything I say is offensive. Here goes! The bad news is that as with most mental health issues, there's no nice and easy solution. Well, there is, but it isn't sustainable or healthy. I guess a good starting point is to realize that some people just aren't going to like you. That's okay. The thing is, if you don't try, nobody is even going to *know* if they like you or not. I know I've missed plenty of opportunities because I'm too busy thinking about what *might* happen. The problem resolves itself because I waste so much time thinking about it that I miss the opportunity to actually *do* anything. And so I end up sitting on the couch, posting on reddit. The best advice I can give you, and I understand that it is quite difficult to actually apply, is to just let go. Just refuse to give a shit about what other people think. Be selfish. Be arrogant. Be a fucking asshole. Instead of doing what you think will be the least confrontational option, just do what *you* want. Every time that little voice of doubt creeps in, say *fuck you, I do what I want*. You'd be surprised how little other people actually mind. Don't let yourself get caught in thought loops about how other people are so much better than you, how they are so happy and have it so together, because *they don't*. Everyone, every single piece of human meat on this planet, is either making it up as they go, or using someone else's idea (that is equally made up). Maybe you aren't a billionaire playboy. You don't have to be. Think of what you'd like in a romantic partner. Do you require perfection? I know I'd just like someone I can connect with reasonably well, someone who genuinely enjoys my company, someone who doesn't offend my senses. You don't have to be perfect. If you don't stink, congratulations, you made it. *Homeless people* get laid. Drug addicts get laid. The shittiest of human beings find another human being willing to spend their lives together. You, my friend, are not the shittiest of human beings. You just think too much. Relationships have a push/pull dynamic. The reason people don't text you back is that you're always texting them. Give them an opportunity to text you first. Trust me, you don't want to be friends with someone who's only doing it out of pity. It doesn't feel good. If you want to practice talking to people, talk to me. Force yourself to make eye contact. Be uncomfortable, analyze it, learn it, look at it from as many angles as possible. Talk to strangers. Some will tell you to fuck off, some will just have a conversation with you, some will straight up ignore you. That's okay. You can ignore people too, you just don't because you're too busy thinking about their feelings, their needs, their thoughts. That's very empathetic of you, and it shows that you have an incredible capacity for empathy. But it isn't healthy to constantly place the *perceived* needs of others above your own. You admit that you aren't even sure of what people are thinking. You can't read minds. So stop trying to. Just *stop*, and think about *you*. What do you want to do? Not with other people, not around other people, not anything to do with other people. What do *you* like, what are *you* passionate about? On the sidewalk? That's something you have in common with literally every person you walk past on the sidewalk. At a concert? That's something you have in common with literally every person at the concert. It is okay to be honest with those people. Just say, ""Hi, some dillweed on the internet told me I should talk to strangers. How about this sidewalk, eh?"" Like I said, some people will be rude, some will ignore, but some will be amazed that a stranger talked to them without trying to sell them something. Offer hi fives or give a thumbs up if you see someone do something worthy of it. Pay for a stranger's coffee. I don't care, just do something without wrapping your head around it three times, you know? Or don't, I'm not the boss of you. But you know what, Arabian Disco, internet pal of the last ten minutes, I give a shit about you. I think you're not an idiot. I think you're a competent human being. You obviously have a great sense of self-awareness and the ability to communicate effectively. You're just tripping over your own metaphorical feet, trying to plan out every action and reaction. The universe is a messy place, man. I am, at the time of this posting, in control of, like, 10% of my life, max. I live in a building I don't own, wearing clothes I didn't buy, on medications I didn't choose, in a city I don't run, in a province I barely know anything about, in a country founded a couple hundred years ago by a bunch of folks who stole it from the people already living there. My life is a goddamn joke. So I've done what I can to find a way to laugh about it. I hope shit gets better for you, man, I really do. Sloppy, sweaty, uncomfortable internet hugs, for whatever they may be worth. I hope my rambling gives you something new to work with. Good luck!",2015,depression,1,0

Stop thinking about being like others, it is better if you focus on being you. If thinking about a destiny is making you feel bad then stop thinking about that.

But now, I say why not? I just delay my medication. I don't feel great for a few days after, but actually, it's worth it. Or it can be something small, I like to be in bed by about 2115hrs because I have an early start each day. But I can get talking to a friend, and think, well, why not act my age and stay up until midnight like every normal 18 year old does? I just delay my second medication a bit so that I can stay awake.

"Don't blame yourself for only being able to afford to rent one bed in a shared flat. A lot of this problem is due to the society around us and is not of your doing. In the UK in the 1960-1970's a single labourer could afford a house for their family. They may also have scrapped by but they had more than many do now. That is not your fault. Now it takes two good salaries to have the same as my parents generation did. Again, this is not your fault and being angry about it is only a natural and rational reaction. I and many others are also angry about this situation. So much so in fact, that in Scotland where I live we just had a referendum to leave the United Kingdom. 45% of people hate the situation so much that they no longer want the political union. To me it sounds a little like you are in that group but don't realise how many other people feel like you do. I had the same idea that women want that self-assured man with a good job. Many do but that is often because they can't see past the glossy images that the media sells them. Again this is not your fault. That however doesn't solve the issue of loneliness that maybe you have but it may help rationalise it. Meeting a good partner is hard and you may need to turn over many rocks to find the diamond. Your lack of experience could actually be a selling point. My partner is impossibly jealous at even the slightest hint that I had a past relentionship - regular arguments for 4 years. I actually think this is inbuilt into many people. That makes you a catch as any partner would not have anyone to be jealous of! I like Star Trek and in one episode the chief engineer says ""Their is no roller-coaster as bad as marriage"". I know it is impossible without the experience for you to make a good comparison but many people feel trapped in their relentionship. They would often like to be in the position you are - single; however that is only possible to really understand with the benefit of having been in a relentionship. When I was in your position I met a woman. After I got to know her she said I was literally shaking when I first met her and she thought it was cute. The relentionship didn't work out but it shows hows odd things can sometimes work in your favour. ""barely able to function in a world full of people doing adult things"" - I think that adults only look like adults because they are taller than children. I think that people look different than how they feel. That means that other people see you as an adult even though you don't feel like one. In return you see them as adults even if they don't feel like one! The saying is ""The only difference between men and boys is the size of their toys"".

"Wow I totally get this. Except that I'm the SO needing help. I've got a myriad of mental health problems, social anxiety included, and due to where I live professional help has been scarce. My boyfriend lives with me and has to help me immensely. Honestly, you have to take care of YOURSELF first before you can take care of him. You sound pretty frazzled right now (as you should be) and pretty soon you won't be able to take care of him effectively and then you're both in trouble. You're doing a great service for him. I know how much shit I put my boyfriend through, but we truly love each other and so for us (just like for you), it's worth it. You're not crazy for staying with him and your stress about this is completely reasonable. But in order for you to help him the best, you have to take care of yourself. What's your social life like outside of him? If you can, try to spend fun, meaningful time with other people once in a while. Are you making sure to get enough sleep, enough to eat, enough free time? This may seem like a silly question but taking care of your basic needs first will help reduce your stress. Have you considered therapy? I know that sounds like an odd suggestion, but I'm of the belief that most everyone, regardless of mental health status, can benefit from therapy. Talking to a therapist (who understands your boyfriend's social anxiety) can help you find better ways to cope with his problems and help you feel a little less alone. You do not have anyone in your life you can talk to about this, which is why a therapist is so great. A third party who is truly understands mental illness and will be entirely non-judgmental. I know things get really hard sometimes, and I imagine your boyfriend feels a bit of shame around that. But I learned that loving someone means loving them whether they are sick or healthy. My boyfriend has some very severe physical health problems and I often have to help him. It's part of being in a relationship. But the other part is taking care of yourself. YOU have to come first, otherwise you won't be able to help him. You're not alone and your feelings are totally justified. Best of luck to you both.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"I have both SA and depression, and I know from experience how both of you feel. First to all the posters calling him lazy because he doesn't do dishes, that is simply not fair. When I am in a depressed state, getting out of bed to play video games is actually an accomplishment. In fact, just keeping from killing myself takes all my strength. Doing something that is as seemingly simple as the dishes seems like a totally impossible task, and that's without being triggered by walking into the kitchen. Now, that doesn't completely excuse your bf from doing anything. If he does nothing but play video games, his SA will not improve. It's as simple as that. His depression might though (since for me it comes in waves, lasting up to about half a year, just waiting it out is sometimes all I can do.) So my advice is to have him come out with you maybe once a week. Let him sit in the car and not go in, or go at night when no one else is there. Also, if he doesn't already play them, encourage him to play online games with voice chat, were you have to interact with other people. And example of this would be Counter Strike:GO. You can't really get good at that game unless you get good and vocally communicating with your team. Encourage him to find work online, there are plenty of low paying gigs you can get to help with bills. Places like mturk.com, elance.com, freelancer.com, fiverr.com and a host others if you spend some time looking.

"Also a throwaway as I hate talking about it, but I'm the same way with an incest fetish. I have no interest in having sex with any of my relatives, but porn is very enhanced by imagining that as a part of it. Two things to it: 1. I believe a lot of SA comes from not bonding with people and not being able to have relationships. My fetish makes there be an ""automatic bond"" as family members and often comes as a ""unfettered access to automatic love"" style. Yours is an opposite similar in that it presumes no relationship/love between them. 2. Some podcasts I listen to talk about how many of these fetishes are set early on in our development, as in people with pregnancy fetishes often had mothers who were pregnant when they were young. I know I spent those years not getting enough attention and trying to get my mother and sisters to notice me. Did you experience people mocking you in your childhood, especially people you wanted attention from? I also agree with suspicion of negative energy. I find when I access porn in a ""She could be my girlfriend, I deserve someone like that, I'm going to get a girl that hot"" it feels positive and enhances my self-worth, whereas incest porn comes with a backhanded ""I end up with someone related to me because it's easy/guaranteed and I can't get someone normal"". I've beat a lot of my SA but still don't really have a fulfilling real life, but I'm hopeful that when I get out, get friends, get a girl, that I won't see any benefit from this fetish and it'll fade.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

Once you find those real ones, then the parties will come, trust me. And the changes will come.

"Never really thought of the two being connected but I definitely relate. Along with my SA, I get anxious from intimacy (before, during, and after). This has ultimately altered my sexual performance and has caused strain in my past relationships. I'm definitely submissive and the idea of a guy being submissive in a sexual relationship is (wrongfully) looked down upon. In past sexual relationships I've managed to get lucky and find myself wrapped up with women who took on a more dominant role or at least realized that I wasn't going to go ahead and do it. Eventually certain relationships would take the direction of completely emasculating me in the bedroom with the underlying pretense of it being 'play'. This was comforting because I knew the things she was doing was not in direct response to my performance or what have you but it was a response to the assumed role that we had delegated ourselves. There's probably a lot more to it; self-confidence issues, lack of dominant figures in my life otherwise, the void developed from the lack of control one develops when suffering from anxiety and having someone you're emotionally and sexually attracted to fill it, etc. &gt;other times I think perhaps its only reinforcing the underlying cognition of the social anxiety, and feeding me with negative energy. This is something I can relate to as well. It might be nuanced for me because I don't really watch humiliation porn but there was an instance in the past of having a girlfriend dominate me emotionally and physically. After the act I was extremely upset and jarred because she was really going in on me and identifying key parts of my psyche to hold control over and tear down. We had talked about it afterwards and kept it more light, me still being submissive in the bedroom. All in all, it's not something I'm particularly embarrassed of. I've managed to quell the need for humiliation by also quelling my underlying anxiety. It was nice having the visage of ""this is all just play"" established before stepping into the bedroom. I've managed to become more open with my partners and humiliation doesn't really play that huge of a role anymore (even though it's definitely still a fetish of mine and when all is said and done I'll always be a more submissive person in the bedroom).",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

Getting wrapped up in an art or craft project for a few days (sometimes weeks) is the only solace I have found when I start getting really anxious for one reason or another.

I only really socialise in more controlled environments, and cant drink more than a couple of drinks at most.

"Anger comes from pain. Your probably experiencing a lot of pain and you get these ideas sort of naturally, just your predisposition. But hurting others wouldn't really change that, it would make things worse, and it would be horrible for the others just like it would be horrible if it happened to you. You probably know that anyways. You should definitely get help in dealing with this. You know it's a problem. I would say it's more like ideas in your mind, just like there are a lot of ideas like this on TV shows and movies. I saw something somewhere where some people have thoughts, sort of on the level of ideas, of killing people often, when they are angry. They wouldn't do it, but their minds work like that. For some people, that comes with feeling angry. But then, a lot of times they don't even know that first they feel pain, then they feel angry. That's part of what you can talk about with a therapist. It's actually pretty thoughtful of you to post this on here because it just shows that you're thinking about it. I think it's important to remember that, as strange as this may seem, even when you have thoughts like this, its an expression of the opposite. It's an expression of caring about the world but things aren't going right or working out right. I guess it's a way of being mad at the world. Which we all get like sometimes. But nothing is worked out at the level of killing yourself or others. Things only get worked out as you live your life. Definitely get help and tell them about your thoughts. If you can, when you start thinking like that, just start pulling out and say to yourself that this is not a good direction. Something tells me you've developed a bad habit of thinking like this, almost like a TV show about such horrible things, but don't let your mind go there. It might go there a little bit, just like it does for most people, but don't keep going there. It's just a big mistake, but it seems like you don't quite realize that. It's almost like a bad habit. Even if you feel a lot of pain, and that does happen at times, you don't have to go there and, it's really wouldn't help at all. It would make things much, much worse. I think your mom is wrong on this one. You're the smart one here. I think that if you feel like killing yourself or others you can actually call the police aand they might take you to the hospital but don't be threatening on the phone or in person, of course. Just be calm. but if you wait for the evaluation, then you should tell them in the evaluation. A lot of people might be afraid to answer your post. They don't want to say the wrong thing.

Uncharacteristically, you made an effort to be closer to her in order to observe her better, to ""see how social people do this"". You express little to no interest in developing more of a personal relationship with her, especially since you felt ""no real connection there"", so you've ruled out that these feelings are based on a desire for a interpersonal connection with her. However, I can say that this sort of feeling is similar to something I've experienced. Funny thing is, I don't think I've ever heard of anyone else describe/analyze/understand this feeling in the same terms as I have. It's like a crush or falling in love. But it's not. The difference is, you don't necessarily have that comfortable cool connection with the other person. Where you talk easily and share hobbies in this awesome way. But you do admire that other person greatly and aspire to be more like them. And may crave their validation and respect. Certainly their company, so you can learn from them.

Also, you'd want to try to share some sort of skill or something with them that will benefit them as well. But... I've always had the insight to know that actually *being* in a relationship with such a person wouldn't work out- not without that connection, that comfort.

"&gt;He's uncomfortable with me meeting his family, I wouldn’t let that bother you. It’s not you, it’s them. I didn’t end up this broken by accident and I’m not going to put someone I love at the same risk any more than I’m going to lend my favorite book to a family of termites. Everything else sounds like an inability to believe that you’d really want him, which is pretty much the basis of social anxiety after all. If you were never quite good enough for your family, why would you be good enough for anyone else? *“Sure, you say the right things and seem to stick around, but that’s just because you’re far nicer and more diplomatic. In the end, you’ll see the same things they saw in me, get sick of me and leave.”* By not labeling you his girlfriend and not wanting to answer questions about you to people… he delays it from becoming real in the hopes that that will delay the inevitable day when it ends. And when you don’t end it, he’ll do it on your behalf. *“She should have dumped me by now, apparently she’s too kind for her own good and can’t bring herself to hurt me. I need to let her go be happy and not deal with me.”* In the end though the majority of the work is probably his responsibility. You have to see that you’re doing it, try to understand why you’re doing it, then forcefully prevent yourself from doing it if its ever going to get better. If he leaves it up to someone else to accommodate, the voice that drives the SA will always find a way to argue it away and attribute their actions to something else. And if he doesn’t work on it, he’ll drive you away and his fears become a self-fulfilling prophecy. As far as your part, communication is probably all there is for you to do, but that is really a huge thing. Problems have to be talked about to get fixed. The problem with SA is that its good at taking anything you say and spinning it into evidence. *“ah see, she does see your flaws and they do bother her, you need to let her go and stop punishing her.”* Which doesn’t mean you shouldn’t say it, you just have to be smarter than the SA. A lawyer’s approach, anticipate how your opponent is going to respond and phrase it in a way that doesn’t leave them room to twist it, then have a follow up that cuts it off at the knees if they do run with it. Also, people with SA seem to have a severe approval deficiency. So it seems cheesy and might not be well received by everyone, but a regular flow of approval is a good way to get them to start believing some of it. And to that end, covert approval works better for me than direct. *“You have really good taste in books.”* gets dismissed as someone just trying to be nice and make me feel good. Whereas *“wow, can I borrow a bunch of these books?”* hides it well enough to slip past my cynical SA.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"Not sure attachment disorder is accurate here. The following comment (made by a PhD) came up in a listserv I am on and sums up pretty well why it's likely the dad is wrong here: ""RAD refers to a very specific presentation, which is socially isolating behaviors, meaning lack of an attachment figure (DSM-5). In the DSM-4, the indiscriminate friendliness was also considered RAD, but this is no longer the case given mounting evidence that this type of behavior is not related to attachment behavior. When talking about ""attachment problems"" you must discuss problematic attachment behavior, which is seeking comfort from a discriminated attachment figure during times of distress. Studies demonstrate RAD is exceptionally uncommon, and typically resolves within months of the child being placed in a welcoming and accepting home. What I suspect you are referring to are children with significant emotional and behavioral problems who also happen to have a history of abuse/neglect, multiple placements, etc. Despite what a number of well-meaning clinicians believe, this is not RAD nor do these children necessarily demonstrate ""attachment problems."" A number of maltreated children in adopted/foster care develop attachments to their new caregivers, love them and rely on them for support, and continue to display severe and profound emotional and behavioral concerns; this is not an attachment problem.""",2015,mentalhealth,1,0

"First off, well done for seeking help, its a really tough decision to make as an adult, never mind a teenager. It's going to depend on where in the UK you are, and availability of beds. If you have been kicked out of home then you should not be placed back into the community until a care plan has been arranged. Because you are 16 and by being in hospital considered vulnerable, you should be assigned a social worker. This may take time and you may not be able to stay on the ward you are in now, most assessment wards are short term, a few weeks to 2 months. Long term patients are usually waiting for rehab places to come up, and cannot be discharged or they lose their place in the system. If you continue to self harm while in hospital, they WILL move you to an intensive care unit, possibly with very unwell adults. If you still hurt yourself, you will be moved to a secure unit. This may be many miles away, depending on where you live. My suggestion is that you ask your named nurse (you should have one) to explain everything to you.

I had a colleague who was a mental health dietician and she advised a client on Olazapine (another anti-psychotic med) that many mental health meds cause weight gain as they muddle the signals the body sends the brain about hungry and thirst. She advised him to increase his fluid intake and have a glass of water before snacking. She said in many instances the sense of hunger goes when the thirst is quenched. Also be aware of snacking in general and check with yourself if you are truly hungry or feeding an emotional need. I put on loads of weight with one of my anti depressants but think it was largely because I was eating to block out feeling crappy as the medication wasn't fully working.

I go from different area of interest(I completely blanked out on the word I was looking for) to different area of interest. I enjoy reading and watching movies, but I get up repeatedly to walk around or switch positions. I constantly fidget and people think I have social anxiety because of it. I often forget assignments and daydream in class. My teachers say I pay attention great and am just lazy, I need to try harder. I've almost failed several classes, but because its not EVERY class, I receive no special care plan at school. I keep my grades up, but not without extreme effort. I will often go room to room struggling to remember what I was planning on doing, get distracted, finally remember what I was doing, and forget again and am forced to wander hoping I remember. Now my boyfriend. He's also 17, in 12th grade. He zones out, has trouble listening and being agreeable at times. He's forgetful and has a hard time managing time. This leads to him turning in projects and homework late, and often. If he does not take medicine he cannot sit still and will be all over the place in hyper activity. He bounces from subject to subject and is pretty distractable. He talks nonstop at times. We both were diagnosed with AD(H)D. He was diagnosed in early elementary. I wasn't diagnosed until 10th grade. And only after I persevered for a diagnosis for two YEARS. Despite being told nothing was wrong with me. Girls can have AD(H)D too.

"So many responses :) I'll add one to the list. I read the director of the NIMH comment about a new direction he hopes to take for the organization and approach to diagnosing and treating mental illnesses. He mentioned how the current approach, largely based on the DSM, while adequate in some regards, is mostly a system that relies on describing disorders in terms of clusters of symptoms. He's planning on changing that focus, to ""transform diagnosis by incorporating genetics, imaging, cognitive science, and other levels of information to lay the foundation for a new classification system."" While he says there is a lot of work to be done, I'm still hopeful to see such a large and seemingly necessary shift in the approach to understanding mental illness being undertaken at some of the higher levels of mental health policy institutions. It's going to mean big and likely beneficial changes to the understanding and treatment of mental disorders in the long run.

I began exhibiting negative/weird behavior around him, such as always looking away when we made eye contact, not smiling, and generally avoiding him due to fear.

Of course, this is all guesswork, but it seems like he probably felt he left a bad impression after that visit at your house and he withdrew a bit.

I think he genuinely doesn't know how to react to all of this attention that you're giving him. Not sure about what advice to give other than to continue to show interest as long as you're interested, but to back off a bit when he seems reluctant. You can always come right out and ask him if you've done something to make him uncomfortable, but I don't know how he'll react or if he'd be willing to open up.

They'll give you suggestions on how to handle your SA and carry out actions to get better. Do you have any acquaintances you already say hi to? Making conversation with them will help. I think talking about school first is a good way to start off. Hopefully you'll be at school more too. Try to make goals with attending and maybe rewarding yourself? If you can go to school everyday for two weeks, buy yourself something nice. Maybe try to adjust them based off how much school you've missed.

"Lurker here, and this post jumped out to me to the point that it warranted a response. Needless to say, I can deeply empathize with you, although my thoughts tend to center around a particular theme (social/economic behavior). Conspicuous consumption is something that triggers the judgmental part of my character. Or, it might be someone who is driving 20 mph below the speed limit. To your second question, there is a way to _manage_ these thoughts. As for stopping them? I can't say for sure. But here's a great start: don't emotionally react to your thoughts. Accept that intrusive thoughts will enter your consciousness unannounced, and that you will be aware of them. With that said, imagine these thoughts as being contained within 'floating boxes' in your mind, and let them pass along like the flow of water or the direction of the wind. Once you acknowledge that your mind can be a nexus for random, uninvited thought, you can _accept_ this and just let what is, is. Non-reaction takes time and deliberate practice. I learned of this approach through meditative and mindfulness techniques, though I don't believe it's termed ""non-reaction;"" I'm not sure what the textbook/clinical name of for this approach is. It's conceivable that these intrusive thoughts could stop after you not responding to them long enough. Personally, I can't confirm this, but I don't worry myself with the outcome of my practicing of mindfulness. As long as just see thoughts -- any thoughts -- as just 'thoughts,' it's much easier for me to handle my emotional response. I hope you found this somewhat helpful. :)",2015,mentalhealth,1,0

"You get into some therapy, as you need an objective third party to help guide you through this. But a bunch of random things: This got tons better for me when I read up on Stoicism. Particularly http://www.amazon.com/Art-Living-Classical-Happiness-Effectiveness/dp/0061286052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420444904&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+living really helped me just accept that whatever happens, happens. You'll have ups and downs and none of them should really affect you feeling bad in whatever you are about to do in the future. It helped to read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_%28psychology%29 as I used to constantly go ""If only I had done X instead of Y, things would have been perfect"". But in reality, doing Y could have made things ten times worse, for all I know. There's no reason to regret that mistake, because not doing it could have caused something much worse to happen. But the secret here, given your quote of ""My parents are really pissed and they are making me"" is that you are probably used to it and it's normal. I guess they over-react and raise drama whenever a mistake is made? And this leads to you obsessing over them and only feeling valued when you are perfect? It took me some therapy to break out of that and realize how toxic it was, how I should be happy being my own person, and other people shouldn't be forcing themselves on me and making me feel bad. Now I just kind of laugh when my parents get mad, and I keep doing whatever it is I most want to do at the time. If they want to be angry people and live a bad life, that's on them.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"This was, over analysis is a big symptom of social anxiety. Funny thing is, most the time the negative over analysis causes you to find ""proof"" of what you fear to be true, when in reality, the so called evidence you acquired to support your delusion is very weak, and not significant. In your case, your mother put the thought in your head that you were being needy and pushy. Due to social anxiety, you started finding ""evidence"" that you were, indeed, being too pushy and needy, and that surely this friend will flake on you. The fact that you've known this friend for quite a while shows that the thought of him flaking is just irrational, and is probably caused by social anxiety.

"Story time. I went to boarding school for high school and having social anxiety made it a living nightmare at times. I do wish I was smarter about what I did in high school. The one thing I wish I knew was that no one gives 2 fucks about who you are and what you like. I forced myself to do things other people thought were cool because I thought it would make me friends. I had a couple of people who would be friends for 2 months and be assholes to me for 3. What's worse it that some of those people I lived in the dorms with. However there was this one guy who had figured out that it doesn't matter what other people think because in the end it doesn't matter. He has gone on to be very socially successful. Not saying that this won't be a hard thing to do but because of my social anxiety and fear of what people thought of me I shut myself away from everyone. Also don't get caught into the trap that it's everyone else's fault. Yeah there are assholes in high school and life but if you want something you have to go for it at your all and not let others stop you. I didn't do that and I'm 25 years old, never had a girlfriend, never even kissed a girl, never made friends who I will remember past college all because I had constant irrational fears.

"I met a friend at university who had social anxiety way worse than me. I gravitated towards him because it was obvious he was shy and it felt a safer way of meeting people than someone really outgoing. He was 32 and just starting university. He spent 10 years as a complete hermit not leaving the house for anything before a carbon monoxide leak nearly killed him and his mother and forced him out. That was sort of a catalyst to make him push himself and he signed up to uni. He didn't get his first job until 35. We shared a flat together for the next 3 years and he is now living in London, and is working. He isn't cured of social anxiety but is better than he was. I am a massive introvert whereas he isn't, which I think makes it way worse that he spent 10 years craving social interaction without having any.

On the flip side, it sounds lke you're having personal problems and your family is not helping you understand. Being yelled at and callled names isn't helpful it makes things worse.

"I would do two things. First, just know that sometimes people don't mesh well. It really could be nothing wrong with you. Sometimes people's personalities don't connect with each other. Or maybe you guys just didn't have enough in common. Or maybe she just has her own stuff going on. So it really is just a trial and error process. The main thing is to just continue working on yourself, keeping yourself active and pushing yourself socially. Eventually something will happen and you'll meet some people that you get along with. (Probably when you least expect it.) Now if you think you are doing something wrong, or there's something that's pushing people away, that can be tricky. I would talk to a close friend and ask them if they have noticed anything. Or even just go talk to a therapist/psychologist, and see if they can help you identify and resolve whatever problems might be there. It can be difficult sometimes, but it can also be helpful to go through that process. To become more mindful of who you are and what problems you face. And then learn how to overcome them by using a support system. It's a great learning experience. Another thing I'd say (and I might be biased) but I think friendships and relationships are a lot more meaningful when you can engage people in person.

"I assume you mean drugs of the illegal form? I've only ever experimented with weed, and if anything it makes me more anxious. Weed affects me very strongly. The first time I smoked I started hallucinating and threw up. I start getting the spins really bad after just 2 hits. Obviously that feeling is not conducive to normal interaction. I feel like an alien when I'm high. As for alcohol, yes, it does help me. I'm a very happy drunk. As soon as I start feeling a buzz, I'm just in a really good mood. A lot of my inhibitions disappear, and I'm able to interact more smoothly. That said, I still prefer to drink alone. Now for your third question, I'm not sure I entirely understand. You're asking how I would feel about a girl who does not indulge in such substances, but I like her otherwise? That would depend a lot on how she felt about me, honestly. If she doesn't care that I like some rum when I get home from work, I definitely don't mind if she doesn't drink. If she doesn't drink and wants me to stop drinking, it wouldn't be a deal-breaker. I don't need alcohol or other substances to survive, I simply enjoy it. Maybe I'm a bit of a romantic, but I'd give up drinking in a heartbeat for someone that I loved. If I felt like she was the one, I would be willing to do just about anything for her. That said, I'm not the kind of guy that dates around. I prefer to wait for something meaningful. I think this has a lot to do with what you look for in a relationship. I am not a very good representation of ""guys"" as a whole. A lot of guys my age (20-25) just want some cute girl to warm their bed. I'm the kind of guy that will spend months getting to know you as friends before I decide if it's worth the risk.

I wouldn't say I have low self-esteem, and I'm definitely not shy, I just view myself 100% objectively. I don't expect anyone to be legitimately interested in talking to me. If I had to guess, I'd say that he's holding back because he doesn't want to scare you away. I did that exact thing, and ended up hurting someone that I care about very much. We're still close friends, but friends is all we are. I was just too blind to realize that all she wanted was for me to talk to her. I restrained myself because I was afraid of coming on too strong. She got sick of waiting and found someone else. Keep talking to him, because I guarantee it makes his day when you make an effort to get to know him. I have never felt a greater elation than having a girl talk to me without any initiation from me. It always surprises me, and it makes everything okay because I feel like somebody out there actually wants to be close to me. That said, don't overwhelm him.

Then, in tenth grade, I was in a class debate and I was voted as the best speaker out of everybody on my team.

And occasionally he does ecstasy, cocaine, acid, shrooms... You name it, he's done it. When he actually DOES get a job, he can't hold it for more than a few weeks. As a kid, he definitely stayed in a psychward before. He has ADHD and anger problems for sure. What else is wrong, I'm not sure. He complains his life is so hard and acts like it's our fault. He's afraid of my dog (who hates him) so sometimes he just pees in bottles in his room to avoid coming out. He rarely talks to me or anyone else in the family. He didn't even stay for Christmas. He went to Vegas with friends. He hasn't celebrated Christmas with us in YEARS. Yet he wonders why he feels like he's not apart of the family. 2 or 3 years ago he went to jail for stealing a candy bar. When I was 12 he stole my apple laptop that my grandpa gave me and sold it. He can't stop stealing everyone's shit. He has said numerous times he wants professional help. When we gave him a list of psychiatrists he could call, he didn't call any of them. He expects everyone to do everything for him. My mom said she would pay for his healthcare, he just had to sign up. He never fucking did that either.

I wish I could just go into a social situation without any expectations and respond to things as they come, but I know that if I talk to anyone like that I'll likely start panicking, forget how to talk like a normal person and stand there looking like an idiot. Usually I'll say whatever first pops into my head even if I don't mean it or it's a complete lie just because it's better than the complete silence or ""uhhhhh"" before thinking of an appropriate response. What do you think is stopping you from communicating in these situations? I've been in lots of situations where I should have said thanks to someone but didn't and I feel like every time it's because when something happens I have a sharp spike in panic and by the time I think of a response it's too late to not be awkward, which then makes me feel like a rude prick and then immediately after like I'm pathetic. I've never been diagnosed with aspergers but I do feel like it's a possibility. Gah. I don't know. Sorry for the wall of text, I hope some of it makes sense!",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"Firstly, I'm not sure what you mean by *having healthy sexual aggression with women*. Sexual aggression is presumably only ever *healthy* if it is controlled and consensual. Secondly, the anger issue: the good news is that it is controllable and that it is not inevitable. It is not linked to the past nor does it set the way forward for the future. It is happening here and now and it can stop here and now. Thirdly, stop feeling ashamed and don't hate any part of yourself. The first step to getting better is accepting yourself with flaws and all. You are capable of enormous acts of kindness. The guilt, shame and self-loathing that you feel are indicators of how the violence is *not* part of you. Fourthly, understand that the monster is not inside you. Each time that the anger comes out, a monster is born. Each time the anger dissipates, the monster dies. In other words, your behaviour is *not* shaped by your past. In each moment, it is within your power to stop the monster being born. You don't need therapy, friend. You need help and support. You can find this in therapy, but you can also find it in free online courses about mindfulness; you can find it in buddhist centres; you can find it in churches; in religion; in CBT counselling. My advice is to give mindfulness a whirl and to find out if there are any local buddhist centres.",2015,Anger,1,0

As a result, most people believe that we think first and then our body does what our brain says. This is just the brain getting conceited and thinking it is the top dog. You began by pulling the tyre. In other words, you were using force to bring something closer to you. Your brain was aware of this. There was resistance and you couldn't *get* what you wanted to *have*. Your brain was aware of this. You try to kick it loose. Your brain is aware of kicking the source of resistance.

Your brain hasn't evolved to distinguish between inanimate objects like car tyres and animate objects like predators who are trying to attack you. Left to its own devices, your brain will sometimes get it all wrong. Underpinning this too is an irrational belief. Yours was presumably something like, ""I should be able to make a journey without the tyre going flat. When I can't, I find it annoying."" ""When I want to change a tyre, I should be able to do so without having to expend any unnecessary effort. The tyre should come off easily and I should be able to proceed with the minimum of disruption."" Seen expressed like these, these are absurd thoughts. Tyres go flat all the time and none of us is saved from the experience. Things get stuck all the time. Life dumps on us all the time. We should expect it to happen and not be too upset when it happens. The stoics have an exercise where they regularly contemplate things going wrong and how they will deal with them.

"I have never had to read out loud in school, but once I had a group project in my freshman year at college and we were supposed to go over a text material together, so each of us would read two pages out loud.

I get the same symptoms every time I give presentations in class: shaky hands+legs, shaky voice, fast heartbeats and irregular breathing. I felt embarrassed every time I would present because of those symptoms that made me act awkward. Eventually I started taking Propranolol (aka Inderal) two hours before giving my presentations, because I felt too embarrassed to act like that. It works amazingly, every time, I couldn't believe I was able to stand in front of 30 people and talk without having to worry about my appearance (voice and body shakings). It removes all of the stupid symptoms and allows me to deliver the presentation normally.

"Well you're a good man for posting this because most people are too afraid to say they're desperately lonely, or sad, even anonymously. I couldn't have done this at 18 and I can barely do it now. Keep fighting. I don't think you're doing yourself a favor though by thinking about what society expects of you. I think society expects you (a man) to embrace your loneliness in both its desperate moments (which you're experiencing now) and its enlightening moments (which you will experience inevitably in forms you probably can't anticipate right now). And along the line you'll find in these moments of solitary reflection in your lonesomeness and sadness, many reasons to live besides not wanting to upset your family - which is actually an excellent reason and I'm glad it's one you've thought of. Your family needs you. Don't feel guilty if you can't exactly reciprocate the compassion they have for you - one day you will, and you'll understand.

"This sounds just like what I went through. Through out high school and university i always had this feeling that something had to be wrong, I never knew what it was, it's just something wasn't right or something bad was going to happen.

I had panic attacks, racing thoughts etc... I never got diagnosed, but my therapist was quite sure it was just anxiety. I can't diagnose you or anything but it sounds just like general anxiety disorder (GAD).

Anxiety can do a lot of scary shit to you, trust me i've been there.. Brain fog, lack of concentration, mood swings, exhaustion, i've experienced it all. I'm doing heaps better now and I can pretty much thank positive thinking for that... You got to keep yourself occupied, get a hobby, do something which takes your mind off of the negative feelings. I'm so desensitized to all of it now that whenever I feel like something is wrong with me (e.g i thought i was schizo, bipolar, had a brain tumor at one point) I just say ""ehh.. how many times have I thought I was all these things"" and just move on with my life.

"I feel the same way, except for wanting to be alone, I enjoy being alone and am most of the time. Had lots of friends but they all left me, got no one now, finished school and too scared to get a job cause i think I can't do it, freak out whenever I have to go out. Am exactly like you, and I didn't do anything about it, sat around for literally a entire year and never had a job, 19 now and think it's pathetic, no friends, never been in a relationship all cause of my SA. And like you I wanted to kill myself, still do most days but can't cause I know it will hurt my family and they are the only people who were always their. I can't tell you It's going to be easy, I've waited an entire year for things to get better and they still havn't, you can't wait for things to get easier, you have to try and make them better, maybe start small and try and build your confidence, like try making friends off reddit to play games with and chat, most won't last long, but it'll help build social skills, if you have any old friends try and get in touch again and catch up. Heck I may have major SA but if someone wanted to hang out, friend or stranger I'd jump at the oppurtunity. Every now and then I find something that allows me to get into a sort of I don't care mood, like a really good song, I just don't care once i'm in that mentality, I smile a lot more and people approach me more easily and I feel better, but it's hard to get into that state of mind. But hey you said you don't mind being alone, that's not a bad thing neccessarilly, lots of people enjoy being alone. I always said before leaving school, all you need in life is like two friends, just two to hang out with, the rest can be on games it dousn't matter, you can have more than two, funny that those two quickly went seperate ways. I got 0 now, but that's just my mentallity, if you feel you don't need any friends then don't worry about it, if your depressed you don't have any, somewhere even if you scrape the bottom of the barrel there will be someone who wants to hang out.

Sure first impressions count, but the people you want to like you, and be your friends aren't going to hate on you for being nervous in a task like that, just have to make sure you're cool if you talk to them personally.

"What I tell my kids is that it is factually wrong to say that somebody is annoying; what we really mean is that *we find* somebody to be really annoying. It's a small distinction, but it serves to draw attention to the fact that the annoyingness is in our own heads. If we want to be able to be free from it, it is *we* who need to make the effort, not the other person. In your situation, I would recommend going to this guy and apologising for how you spoke to him; tell him that you don't really know why it came out like that, but the truth is that you get frustrated by his questions. You can politely ask him to stop involving you in the game, but repeat that you are sorry for speaking to him in the manner which you did. If he ignores you and continues to pester you with stupid questions, just breathe deeply and really try to focus on your breathing: feel the air coming into your nose, going into your chest, making your stomach rise, and then feel the stomach deflate, the air rising to your throat and passing out of your nose. Do that a few times and then just chill. Reflect on the fact that it appears that this person, for reasons beyond your knowledge, is trying to irritate you. Try and look at it like a scientist would. *Why* would he want to do that? What would make *you* behave in a similar way? Does he need to impress somebody? Does he mistakenly think that this is friendly banter? *Is* it friendly banter? Might the problem be *your* reaction? Should *you* be getting irritated? Does any of it *really* matter? Will it matter in 20 years time? 40? etc.",2015,Anger,1,0
"Good for you! You've reached a turning point - one that many people never actually get to. You show some really solid reflection as well. I was especially impressed by &gt;Most uncomfortable/horrible events in my life can be attributed to me becoming irrationally enraged. This is true for most of us, but most of us never actually realise it and continue to blame the perceived cause of our anger. You're already well along the route of recovery! Being calm and collected is most *definitely* possible. One of the first steps is to abandon the irrational belief that *people should never do stupid stuff*.Just under 2000 years ago, Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of the Roman Empire. He was also a diarist and he wrote mainly about his efforts to try to keep the right perspective of things (his diaries, called *Meditations*, form part of the Stoic canon). One of his most famous diary entries goes like this: &gt;Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a man’s two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Nature’s law – and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction. Now, he was also pretty far advanced along the path of Chill. Your goal can be to get close to that stage when you *expect* people to be stupid...that is just how we are (the same stupidity that made your anger boil over). But you will reach a stage where their stupidity is what endears them to you: you will see in it a need for compassion because they are reflecting back to you your own flaws, your own weaknesses, your own ignorance. You will hear what they say and see what they do and you will think, *Snakes-on-a-plane, that is what I'm like too in the eyes of other people. We're like kids, really!"" Marcus Aurelius is a great read (although he comes across at times as a little *too* pious for me...) If you like that, try reading some of Seneca's letters...they are the business! Epictetus was a Roman slave who became *the* leading stoic. Buddhist thought and ethics is a fantastic source for how to manage anger (and all of the Mind's other little poisons). We live in times where we are just *expected* to be cool and perfect. The ancients realised that in order to be this way, we needed to work on it. The buddhists wrote about how to free yourself from the pains of life and the stoics wrote about how to live your life with virtue. I swear, they are great companions along the path you have chosen to go down.",2015,Anger,1,0

"I know how difficult it can be to go out and be social when you have these insecurities about yourself. It's a constant struggle for me, and I'm really sorry that you're experiencing this right now. However, try to think about it this way: if these people are/were willing to talk to you and be friendly to you, and now they are asking you to hang out with them, they must already like you and think you're worth their time. Even if the first time you go out and realise you have no idea what to say, that's actually okay, because only assholes would not invite you to hang out again for being quiet, and you can use that time not talking to work out what kind of topics are discussed amongst these people you want to hang out with. As for not being able to make new college friends, I would suggest joining online forums or something that's tailored for college students/students studying online, and start talking to people there. I'm not sure if that's a thing, but it might be worth looking in to. Really, you don't need to worry about gaining 'college' friends, just new friends, and they can be found in all sorts of ways. Join a club, go online (most people with social anxiety go online to meet people), volunteer to do something you'll enjoy, etc. No one should have to feel lonely, and you can find ways to ease that empty feeling by talking to people, either in person or online. Heck, I'll be your online friend if you want! Now, working is an entirely different ball game. I'm 24, graduated from university in 2012, and I'm still yet to find a graduate job, mostly because the idea of working full time makes me anxious and I seem unable to handle interviews very well. Finding a job when you have this anxiety is not going to be easy, that's the long and short of it. A job in a store is a good way to go, it's convenient for now, and doesn't ask too much of you. I understand why you are afraid of your co workers finding you weird; that's just what someone with social anxiety believes, that they'll do something, just once, that could be seen as weird, and you feel like everyone must think you're a nutjob. You've fulfilled the insecurities you have about yourself. The thing is, you're stopping yourself from applying to a job because of co-workers you haven't even met yet. You have no idea what they'll be like, or even if they're like you, socially anxious and insecure. They could be lovely, and might not give a damn if you're weird or not. The only way you can know what will happen, is to give it a shot. You just have to tell yourself that, no matter how anxious you feel about it right now. If your manager does make you work cashier, then that'll suck for you, but try to see it as a means of getting better at talking to people. You may be serving someone and feel SO awkward and not know what to say if they say something to you, and that'll probably be the case for a while, but you'll slowly get better and better at it. Trust me, I've worked cashier for years now, the conversations are never too strenuous and all that matters is that you're pleasant. It's a horrible and frustrating to have social anxiety. If you ever feel like it's getting too much for you, and that it really is stopping you from moving on with your life, then you might want to consider counselling. Just talking to someone about how you're feeling and trying out the counsellor's techniques/therapies can be very helpful. Of course, that's costly and requires you to be open and trustful with your counsellor, which is not easy for someone with social anxiety. Again, going online can help, you'll be able to find lots of articles, videos, etc. about how to overcome social anxiety through certain methods. It's not professional help, but it's help all the same. I wish you all the best OP, and I meant it when I said that I'll talk to you and will be willing to discuss more of this with you. Good luck!",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"Every time you see him, say hi, hello, good morning, etc... Start out by making small talk. If it's cold, say ""How are you surviving this weather?"" Something like that. Not much. After a while, start making longer conversations. There's a skill I learned in my fight against SA and I'm working on improving it even more: it's branching off from one topic into another. Think of the conversation as a tree's stem, and the possible conversations as branches. You could take one word he says and turn it into a conversation (hence the branches). It's an acquired skill. Another acquired skill is being able to use minimal things in your environment to start a conversation. So if the room is too hot, use that as a conversation started. If you notice it started raining outside, use that. If the walls are oddly colored, use that. If there's gum under the desk, use that. The teacher said something, use that. You dropped a pencil, use that. The more general it is, the harder it becomes to start a conversation, but it can be done with enough skill. For example, everyone drops their pencils in class. You wouldn't think there's much to say about that, right? Wrong. You dropped your pencil. Pick it up and say ""God, I'm dropping everything today. In my defense I only had 3 hours of sleep."" Just know that if the guy has some form of SA, you'll probably have to do all of the ""heavy lifting."" It'll be your job to keep the conversations rolling and find topics. Don't be afraid of being random and spontaneous. You're both standing there for a while not saying anything, just go like ""SO did you see that new hobbit movie? It's pretty cool."" He won't think it's weird. He'll enjoy that a human is talking to him because we, humans, are social creatures. A human cannot survive on his own. And who knows? He might be a fan of LOTR, so now you got him engaged in a topic he likes, so there's a better chance he'll open up and talk some more. Set yourself a 10-second rule. Next time you see him, you have 10 seconds to go and talk to him, even if it's just something like ""good morning."" 10 seconds, not a second more. You wait more than that, and your mind will start coming up with all of these excuses like ""maybe later,"" ""he looks busy,"" ""I don't feel well,"" etc... Here's a tip (this is especially helpful if you suffer from some form of SA or introversion and don't really like talking [introversion] or you never seem to have much to say[SA]): from my personal experience, I found that the best way to have a conversation is to ask questions and keep the conversation revolving them. Ask questions. If you just give your opinion, unless the other person is social enough to keep it rolling, the conversation will die. Share your opinion every once in a while to make it seem like you're engaged in the conversation, but always keep it around them. That's best done by always ending your part of the conversation with questions. People love it when the conversation is about them. For example, you're in a class and you just got a test result back. Your classmate says ""Aww I got a C."" You say ""I got a B-,"" that makes it seem like you're involved in the conversation, but don't stop there. If you do, the conversation will die. Add ""what did you get wrong?"" You classmate will tell you what they got wrong, so now add ""Did you study for this?"" The classmate will reply. Now you say ""Ahh, I'm a procrastinator. I studied in the last minute. I was too busy watching Interstellar to study. DID YOU SEE INTERSTELLAR?"" See? You commented about yourself just enough to give the conversation the starting push, but you asked questions to get them involved and keep the conversation around them, and now, you have a conversation going.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"I totally feel you. I'm the same age as you and I don't have much friends to hang out with either. I recently tried to get in contact with a friend from high school, but we hung out once and that's all. I made a friend this semester in college, but I hated him so I cut ties with him because he was too self-centered and never cared about me or my worries and always just wanted to talk about himself or do things that benefit him, even if they harm me. The closest I've gotten was to a girl this past semester that I had a terrible crush on and we became really good friends, but I confessed to her my feelings and I lost her as a friend. Losing her kind of made me realize that my need for a friend is much greater than my need for a girlfriend. I don't regret confessing to her, though, because, if I hadn't, I would probably be weeping right now and loathing myself for not being brave enough to confess to her, and I'd definitely be saying ""what if."" And the fact that I lost her as a friend tells me that while I considered her a really good friend and that she meant a lot to me, I didn't mean much to her which is why she had no problem seizing contact with me and ending the friendship. Her loss, not mine. I treated her like a gentleman and I would've made her the queen of her world even if she was only my friend, but she wasn't mature enough to figure out that it's possible to reject a guy but still remain friends. She lost someone who handed her his heart and a knife. I lost someone who probably didn't think much of me. Eitherway, I'm digressing. I just keep myself busy by going out and taking walks. Obviously because the weather is currently 10 degrees (F) where I am, that's not really an option. But when the weather is decent enough, I just go out and take walks. I enjoy going to work because it keeps me busy, but I only work part-time so I don't have work every day. I'm currently in my winter break so it's hell for me because I have to sit here doing nothing for a little under a month, and I don't have friends to hang out with. As much as I dislike college, at least it keeps me busy. I also like skating (although I'm a loner so I skate by myself), so when the weather is good enough, I go down to the skatepark and just skate around for a bit. If I'm lucky, I can hit up a conversation with someone over there. But yeah, walking is what keeps my busy. I try to avoid methods of transportation because they take me from point A to point B fast, and I don't want that. I want to waste a lot of time walking and looking at things around me. If I want to go to a coffeeshop to sit down and have a cup of coffee and read my book, I walk there, even if the walk takes me an hour or two..As long as it keeps me busy.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"First off, have you told your psychiatrist that you went off the medication? You can have major withdrawals if that isn't managed properly.

I've been in therapy for 3+ years and I've struggled to complete many of the tasks set my by therapist. That's totally okay! The assignment was just to help you. Therapy is something where you get out of it what you put in. Your therapist won't just fix you in a matter of sessions, it's an active process that you have to be engaged in. So you didn't call a stranger, okay fine! Talk to your therapist about why that was so hard for you and what you can do to make an easier transition. Maybe call a relative first, instead of a total stranger, for example. Or maybe start even easier. Just remember, you can't fail at therapy or at recovery. This is a long and hard process, and no one does it perfectly. Just keep trying! Be open and honest with your psychiatrist and therapist about this stuff.

There are so many of them, and none of them work for everyone. If you're interested in using medication, it's important to understand that it may be a long, tedious process to find the right one, at the right dosage.

It's a weird feeling and I really don't like it but smoking can at least diminish those symptoms so I can deal with the underlying problem. Being high also brings me closer to the world around me. Rather than feeling like an outsider and being completely disconnected from the world, it allows me to take control of my body and really appreciate all the sensations I get.

"Anger and depression can be similar in a lot of ways, oddly enough. We often find ourselves being angry with something else as an excuse not to be angry with ourselves over things we're unhappy with. For me, I knew that I was being selfish and cruel to other people on some level. But rather than admit that to myself, I would blame other people for failing to act in such a way that they made up for the shortcomings I had. Maybe that's what's happening with you. Maybe it isn't. I think that you've already taken a very important step-- you've figured out what it is that you're unhappy with. You want to be able to let stuff slide and to not get so angry.

Also, don't clean your boyfriends room for him; that's his job. One of his only jobs to be a reasonable human being. Don't clean it for him. Don't be that girl... He can clean his own fucking room. Seriously, don't get used, and if it's too messy for you to tolerate then just tell him that he needs to clean it before you'll come over again. Best of luck. GO OUT DYE HAIR. You have nothing to lose, you're not going to have a panic attack and embarrass yourself over there. Connect with her.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"I sometimes come home to utter disorder and my reaction is to bitch and bitch and bitch. As I bitch, the physical symptoms of anger begin to make themselves felt; as I get angrier, my partner gets angrier; the sense of injustice begins to take hold of me and we start bandying back and forth the *you nevers* and *you always*. Before long, our marriage is up for discussion and accusations are flying to and fro. The problem, of course, is mine. There is no law of the universe that says that happiness is to be found in orderliness. There is no matrimonial contract that says that my wife has to spend her day cleaning and ordering rather than doing whatever she wants to. That said, there is no law that says that I can't come home and expect the house to be spotless and tidy. It's just that my expectations are unrealistic and occasionally lead to great misery. You can't blame your dad! This is *you* we're talking about. The issues are *your* issues (even if they are pretty universal). Understanding that it really *is* all about you will help you decide if anything can be done. Very often, we can distill our options down to two: love your girlfriend more than your expectations; or dump your girlfriend and find somebody who has the same expectations as you. In my case, I love my wife more than I love being able to find a pair of socks first thing in the morning. So, although I occasionally bitch and moan about things, in my head, I know it's really all about me. In the past I felt indignant and slighted; these days, I'd be the first to apologise. That's not enough, of course, and I regularly role play the situation in my head to think of ways of avoiding the red mist. I'd say it's working, but there are miles to go yet.",2015,Anger,1,0

"I'm kind of in the same boat. I'm generally pretty good with interacting with people in my day to day life, but there are some things that are harder for me, like making phone calls to strangers, talking in front of large groups, sometimes eating in public, etc. Based on these feelings I concluded that I do have social anxiety, but I don't have social anxiety disorder. There is a difference. For me it's not a disorder because the anxiety isn't at a point where I can't go about my life normally. However, that doesn't mean my feelings are invalid. You may be the same as me, depending on the severity of your anxiety. Take what I said with a grain of salt though, as I haven't discussed my anxiety with any medical/psychological professionals yet. This is just my own speculation. &gt;The last thing I want to do is to just scapegoat all my problems onto anxiety. I totally get what you're thinking here. If you don't want to turn your anxiety into a scapegoat, then don't! You can have the anxiety, but you're right in thinking that it probably isn't the root of all your problems.

"The first thing is not to care what other people think. The key thing about controlling your anger is that it's for *your* benefit.

The second thing is that it really doesn't matter if you look intimidated and submissive. You can be assertive while controlling your anger - in fact, it's a great tool to *help* you control your anger. U useful method for being assertive is the 3-part response to bullying behaviour: Say to the other person what you don't want using the word, *I* Say to them how it is making you feel. Say to them what you do want using the word, *I* eg *I don't want you to speak to me like that again; it makes me feel belittled, frustrated and angry. I want you to speak to me with respect and with decency.* The important thing is to use the word *I* as this is part of being assertive!",2015,Anger,1,0
"Yeah, I get you. I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder when I was 14. At this time, my anxiety disrupted my day to day life and affected my education, as I was frequently absent from school. I'm 20 now, and I would say I still have problems with social anxiety - I can't make phone calls even if they are really important, I have problems making eye contact, public speaking still gives me panic attacks, there's lot of weird things I don't do because they make me nervous. However I have a full time job, friends and a fairly happy life, where as I would not describe myself as a happy person when I was 14. I think if it makes you unhappy, you should seek help. For me, the first step was going to a GP - I described the problems I was having and told them I thought I would benefit from seeing a psychologist, they agreed and gave me a referral.

"Sometimes I kinda placebo on the side effects of a drug, so take that as you will. However I felt slower and physically depressed, not in the emotional sense (it always made me feel kinda nice and warm and buzzy like I had a beer on an empty stomach but without the dizziness). It chills you out for a bit but I felt like my heart was straining to work after taking it, I did not like it very much. Depressants suck for anxiety IMO and I don't know why doctors think it's a good idea to prescribe them as heavily as they do vs. stimulants. I lose my ability to respond quickly or make witty comebacks or jokes etc. They make me feel stoned, the happiness and mild euphoria is nice but my social anxiety comes back anyways when I've lost the ability to keep up a conversation very well. Adderall or Ritalin, in a low, time-released dosage, makes my social anxiety all but completely disappear. Not only do I gain the ability to listen to people better and respond better, they make me more confident in what I want to say, how I feel I fit in to a group, who I approach or talk to in public etc. I don't even have to work up the courage to approach people or think about what I want to say, I just pretty much do it like I felt it was my place to do so. They make this subconscious thought in the back of my head that I know if I show some friendliness and good personality, it'll make people respond positively, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy cause people smile back and sometimes you create really cool energies between strangers just by breaking the ice.

"Stumbled on this sub completely by accident. Best way to learn to make eye contact is by practicing in a mirror. Stare yourself in the eyes for as long as you can. You'll gradually get better at it over time Developing eye contact skills is the easy part. What you want to do is develop a confident gaze. After you've built up the ability to stare yourself in the eye for a while, start doing it to strangers as you're walking by them. Don't practice this on people you know! Or during an actual conversation! As you look strangers in the eye, one of three things will happen. You'll look away, they'll look away, or you two will continue gazing until you can no longer physically maintain eye contact. When someone looks away from a gaze, if they look down, it's a subservient or submissive gesture. This is usually subconscious. It's basically a gesture that says ""you are more confident than I."" If they look away, they are intentionally breaking the gaze, for any number of reasons. As you stare people in the eye, over time you'll become better and better at doing so, more and more people will break the gaze by looking down. Do this casually, as you walk by a stranger on the street, or somewhere where there's no other social interaction. Don't go out of you're way to stare, once someone breaks the gaze, don't make eye contact again. Never turn to look at someone to keep up eye contact, don't look at other parts of their body (male or female, it doesn't matter). Nod if they nod, say hello back if they do. Keep it amiable. This is what I've done in the past to build my own confidence, but you don't need to stare down everyone you meet. If you have trouble knowing when to make or break eye contact in a conversation, pay attention to when people look away, and don't be afraid to look away at something yourself. But avoid glancing all over the place. The phrase ""shifty eyes"" is in our lexicon for a reason, people get nervous when you glance from one place to another. If even that is difficult, watch actors on tv shows, how they move, make and break eye contact. Law and Order and Star Trek TNG come to mind. Hope this helps, and good luck. If you, or anyone reading this have questions let me know.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"A lot of people who fake it tend to overcompensate, so that while they think they come across to others as ""normal"", they really appear forced and annoying to others. IMO it serves as an emergency strategy in certain situations, but not as a way to live your life, because you're not really accepting yourself as you are, and there will be a price to pay for that in the end. Also, you're not giving other people a chance to accept you as you are - and there are actually those who will do that. Now your question was, has anyone ""beaten"" social anxiety. If you mean becoming cured of it, I can't help you, but if you mean just learning to live with it without daily suffering, I might be able to offer some advice. My story: I'm 49, I've had social anxiety since childhood, but undiagnosed until my 30's. As a small child, my strategy in overload situations was to go to sleep. When I started school, I obviously couldn't just sleep in the middle of the classroom - and certainly not during recess, which was my living nightmare. I would usually hide in a bathroom until the bell rang. I would sometimes throw up just out of anxiety, and that was good, because then I'd get sent home. So basically, school was no succes. I was an A-student, which didn't help, as it just made the other kids hate me more. I did have friends though, that I hung out with after school. I always did well in one on one type situations. Teenage years: Frickin' nightmare! I obviously didn't have boyfriends - not until I was past 20 and desperate enough to sleep with anybody (not a strategy i recommend btw). But basically it was a cavalcade of rejection in all it's glorious forms. I somehow get the idea that that's sort of where you are now. If I look back and try to analyze what I did wrong, I think most of it came from trying to achieve conformity, trying to befriend the wrong people and generally just being desperate to fit in with what I percieved as ""normal"" people. Please bear in mind that at this time I had no idea what was wrong with me - I just knew I was different, and tried to find all sorts of explanations that weren't really my ""fault"". I eventually landed on my looks. I was ugly, that must be it, right!? If people didn't like me because of the way I looked, it was something out of my control, not something I could help, so I couldn't blame myself. In reality I was completely average-looking, and much plainer people have found eternal happiness and succes in life. I just needed something to pin my insecurities on. Lesson learned: Don't do that. Accept yourself for what you are! I know it's hard when you'd rather be so much else, but it's really the only way. You're way ahead of me - you know you have social anxiety, I didn't. You know this is not your fault. My advice to you, if you want to go to parties or whatever other social situations you find yourself in, you can ""fake it"" without actually faking it. Put on your brave face, but if you get to talking with someone, tell them: ""Oh btw. I have social anxiety, so if I seem a little weird at times, it's nothing to do with you, it's just the way I am."" The secret is, everybody's self-conscious, so when people meet someone who stares too much or too weirdly, or suddenly falls silent during conversation or whatever, they take it personally. By coming clean, you have just lifted that burden from your conversation partner and made them feel better about themselves. Most people will appreciate it, and not only that, they will think you're cool for overcoming your handicap. And in turn, you will feel more relaxed in their company, because they know your ""secret"" and have not rejected you :) Of course some people will reject you, but that's going to happen whether you tell them or not. It happens to everyone - people with social anxiety just take it harder. What I discovered eventually was that going to parties, dances etc. was not really my thing. I was better at meeting people in connection with my studies, work and hobbies. The good thing about that is, there's already common ground from the beginning. All in all, I've managed to get married, divorced and be a parent, have a job and hobbies just like regular people. I may not socialize as much in my free time, but then I don't miss it because I don't feel lonely like most people do. Being honest, first to myself and then to others, was a major breakthrough for me. The second breakthrough was exercise. Sorry that was pretty long...",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"I actually had to learn this, and the only reason I ever learned was because of a ""friend"" who had the kindness to tell me that I seemed weird because I never made eye contact. Now in many ways she was a bitch, but I do thank her for that lesson :) When I became conscious of it, I first entered that awkward phase where you do it too much, and that got me in trouble a few times, even in unexpected ways (did you know that men from certain regions of the Middle East take eye contact from a woman as an invitation to sex? I found out the hard way). Eventually I devised a method: Look into the other persons eyes and smile, count 1-2-3, look away, repeat when you're ready. Eventually it comes naturally - it did for me. Interestingly enough, the inability to make eye contact is actually our parents fault. If mum failed to make enough eye contact with baby during the first formative weeks, baby loses the ability.

I know this may sound crazy but I've noticed that friendly hugs are handled over-under (under armpit, over shoulder) and more closer relationships are handled double under (both arms under both armpits) and so if a girl hugs me when leaving or saying hi and I get a double under on her my mind IMMEDIATELY starts to run with the idea that she likes me, plus then I can transition into full guard more efficiently.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"She was probably trying to rob you, you did the right thing. A friend of mine once pulled over for cute girl crying at the side of the road. It was raining and she had her thumb out trying to catch a lift (which is unusual to ever see in the UK, people just don't tend to do it). He felt bad for her so picked her up, and she said she'd just broken up with her boyfriend. She asked if he could drop her at an address nearby. When they got there and she was thanking him he got robbed by two of her friends who opened his doors and took his phone, watch, and wallet. Edit, I just saw the top comment on here from the guy in Birmingham UK, this happened in Wolverhampton UK about 20 miles away!",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"Please don't try to conform to percieved standards of what your life is ""supposed to be""! Your life is your own, you decide how much you want to socialize. If you don't currently feel the need, don't worry, you may or may not at some later time, but in any case it's your choice. Personally I don't have any friends of the kind that come to my home or I come to theirs. I get enough social interaction during the day from work, after work activities and family. I simply don't need any more. I enjoy that my home is my own, where I can do whatever I want :)",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"Speaking from experience - Don't stress yourself out too much - they are cool people, they won't be judging you and probably won't care. Next time you feel like you should go out or want to - just act on impulse and do it before you kill yourself overthinking and never leave. Go and offer to make people a cup of tea (I'm British so we love that shit - not sure if it's the same if you're American lol) - go out there and be nice - then nobody is going to mind :). I also find doing gestures etc and showing an interest in people is great coz then people don't take it personally if you don't hang out or come out your room as much. I'm sure it will be fine though :), just try really hard to push yourself at the start as much as possible - then it will get easy. But f you leave things off for two long (say a month or so) then it's hard to bring it back! Also find the person you most click with/nicest and then start it up with them, and then it gets much easier to talk to the others and come out your room more :).",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"It's been okay. I really feel crappy at work. Anytime I am in a situation which I am not used to, like work or feel like people will reject me (like my bf's mum who I don't get on with) - I'm so quiet, but when I am in casual socialising situations I am way more confident. I know I have good social skills and that people like me and that I am fine - it has taken a while to build up to this (having good experiences with lots of different people has built up my confidence as has cbt). But I have found starting my first job hard - I am really not used to the social rules, how you are supposed to act and have stayed super quiet in order to avoid rejection or making a mistake. There is so much banter at work and it's hard to get used to it and not take it as people hating me, when it's not at all because it's just the culture and everyone banters with everyone. It's so hard to get past WANTING to stay quiet and inhibited because it feels so safe and comfortable, it's like grr work isn't for me a social thing - I have my social life, I feel comfortable in myself - WHY do I have to have socializing at work? It sounds stupid lol, and I know it will help me grow and is good for me - it's good for learning to feel more comfortable in myself and is a necessity. I just am so quiet and feel like I see everyone as rejecting me which is throwing me back outside of work and all the development I have done. I am feeling more anxious and less confident everywhere because of work. I suppose it's a challenge that will ultimately be good for me, and I am confident and happy in situations where I used to feel shy, inhibited and like I wasn't good enough - I am sure I will get to that place at work too :).",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

"Like what cicerothedog said, you shouldn't have the preconceived notion that there's a standard for everyone. It sounds like you're alright without friends, but at the same time, you've never truly experienced what having a close friend is like in the first place. To answer your last question, I don't think you should force anything. If you happen to come across someone who shares some interests with you, and you enjoy being around them, then make an attempt at becoming friends with them by texting them and asking them to hang out or do that common interest some more. Whatever happens from that point happens; There's no need to force it to go any further than you think it should. I'm 23 and have been working my job for about 2 years now. I'm good friends with two of my co-workers and I like to hang out with them on occasion and play video games or go to a bar. It's nothing huge. We're not the kind of best friends like you might have had in grade-school, but it's still nice to have some guys to have some fun with once in a while. Overall, I don't think you should hang on to this notion that you don't want friends. Having a friend is typically nothing but a positive experience.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0
"Relax, she was a stranger. You're not the weird one for refusing a hug which was completely out of the blue.

"Hi. :) First time posting in this sub. I'm 22 years, and though I've never been officially diagnosed, I am 99% certain I had social phobia when I was younger. (When I was 14, I could hardly speak to classmates I had known for over 8 years) I found out that there was something called social phobia/anxiety when I was around 14 or 15. Until then I had just thought I was a freak, and knowing that there were people struggling with the same things as me really helped. The thing I found that helped me a lot was finding something I excelled at. For me, that was drawing and music. As afraid as I was of having 1:1 interactions, I never had a problem with standing in front of a crowd weirdly enough, since I could rehearse exactly what I was going to do on stage. I played the violin, and got a lot of compliments whenever I played at school events. Since I drew a lot I got better and better and started to get compliments on that too. Finding ways to building up self confidence is step one to overcoming an anxiety! My biggest problem was breaking out of the mold I had made for myself. From the little interactions I had with my classmates, I had been categorized as the shy girl who always cried and rarely spoke. When people have preconceptions of you like that, it's hard to change yourself! In the end, although I had already started working on many things, any outward changes didn't happen until I changed school. I cut ties with all my old classmates and tried to think forwards rather than back. I was still nervous as fuck, but I got very lucky and met two girls who shared my interests! The first weeks of school was hell, and I left drained every night after forcing myself to walk over to these girls between class. After about a week I got so nervous that I didn't dare walk over to them again, but *luckily* they came to me instead. During the three years at that school I really developed, and my new friends helped me a lot along the way. But there is *no way* I would have done this way in my old environment. In a way, my new friends were getting to know me at the same time as *I* was getting to know me. On a related note, I find that going back to my old school makes me feel 14 again, and not in a good way. When I've bumped into old classmates I almost revert back to my more anxious self, just because that's the way that these people remember me as and so they talk to me expecting me to be the same. Your environment and associations have a lot to say about how you are going to behave. I find that what you are talking about in your post is what I was like in the beginning, but it will only take you so far. If you are always acting out a personality that is not your own, you'll not get rid of those deep-seeded insecurity. It's like pushing dust under a rug - the dust is still there! What I found works better is instead of constructing a personality, you should find things about yourself that you like and grow the rest of you around that. That way, when someone compliments you they are complimenting *you*. This is going to require some self-awareness. The first step is getting to know yourself and what you'd be like without the anxiety. Be self-aware, but don't fall into self-pity. I'm not going to sugarcoat anything. It's going to be rough, but you *can do it*. Also, be prepared for a lot of ups-and-downs. Though I don't think I'd qualify for social anxiety anymore, I still have good days and bad days, and on the bad days I'd rather not talk to anyone. There is no way to flip a switch to make it go away, but it can get so much better! Tl;dr: don't fake confidence, *get* confidence.",2015,socialanxiety,1,0

I do think other adults must have horrible shit going on all the time. Because I enjoyed my kids more, actually talked a bit more at work, and really cherished a lot of little things. Like driving to work and hearing a good song. A good cup of coffee. A purring cat. Kind of ridiculous I guess.

"I think that your mistake here is in assuming that this is something that you fix. This is going to have to be a team effort. You're onto the right track by believing that there's a bigger underlying cause to her anger than just beach towels and such. That's clearly not what's driving her to anger-- that's just where she's expressing her anger. I think it would be beneficial to have what I call a ""Sesame Street"" talk with her. This is where you toss all hope of things sounding natural out the window and explicitly state what's going on and how it makes you feel. You sound like a character on Sesame Street-- thus the name. So say, ""honey, you've had angry outbursts at [insert examples here] lately, and they worry me. These aren't healthy, and it's putting stress on both of us. I want to help, but I don't know what's wrong, and I can't help unless I know."" It sounds corny, but the advantage here is that there is no room to misinterpret what you're saying. She knows beyond a shadow of a doubt what's going on and where you're coming from. Please know-- there's a good chance she doesn't even realize that she's being unreasonable. A lot of the people on this sub-- myself included-- get so wrapped up in a problem that it consumes them to the detriment of empathy. You become very self absorbed and selfish, and it's only when it's pointed out to you that you realize how you've been behaving. There's a decent chance she will respond to this talk with anger. Be prepared for that-- maybe while your kid is at a sitter's or something. You probably don't want the kid involved.

"A few years ago, my wife had similar issues. Had a sit down where I tried to bring it to her attention. Obviously, I was greeted with ""I am not!"" or ""Those weren't my words."" I said okay, you must be right, perhaps I'm just imagining it. After that heated conversation, I started responding to her angry outbursts (as long as I didn't trigger them) with the exact same tone and fervor that she addressed me with. To use your Incident 1 as an example: Wife: ""Hey Krull, bring me a towel!"", ""Here's your towel."" Wife: ""THAT'S NOT A BATH TOWEL, THAT'S FOR THE BEACH"" ""YOU ASKED FOR A TOWEL, I BROUGHT YOU ONE. IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC ONE IN MIND, BE SPECIFIC."" In my past situation she would respond with: ""DON'T YELL AT ME, I JUST WANT A TOWEL."" To which I responded with: ""I addressed you exactly as you addressed me. All I did was mirror your tone and volume."" ""Whatever"", she would say. Later she would grudgingly apologize. This immature bickering continued for a few months, always playing out the same way. During a calm time, I brought up the issue again and also pointed out a lack of patience and suggested we talk to her doctor. Turns out, anger is a sign of depression/excessive stress and prescribed her a low dosage anti-depressant with the instructions that we could increase the dosage if it didn't take the edge off. 3 months later, with 2 chemical adjustments, she's much, MUCH better.",2015,Anger,1,0

"Take a deep breath. Both of you are extremely stressed right now, and it's going to make you want to behave irrationally. You're right that you messed up and let anger take hold, but there is definitely a bright side to this. You hit an inanimate object as opposed to your mother. Take a moment and congratulate yourself for that. It proves that you still have a ways to go, yes, but it also proves that, even when you lose control, your instinct is not to hurt another human being. That's *huge*. As for dealing with the consequences of your actions: you already have the right plan in mind. Apologizing, even if you think it's her fault, will definitely help matters. You know yourself and you know all of the progress you've made to be less angry. own up to your actions, yes, but also recognize that you spend 364 days out of the year not punching doors or being overly angry. You're extremely stressed right now, and facing a situation that you don't typically see. It isn't an excuse to toss your progress out the window, but it *is* a pretty solid explanation for one screwup (where, again, you *didn't hit a person.* good on you for that.) I don't know your mother and I don't know your relationship with her. But a word of advice as a ""just in case"" anyway: if you spend your time constantly being angry at your mother, you're hurting yourself inside. Forgiving a person doesn't mean absolving them of their sins. It doesn't mean that you're friends, it doesn't even mean that you talk to them if you have a choice.

I get being lonely as a single teenager-- especially when it seems like everyone else is getting it on without you. It's a ton of pressure that isn't made any easier by the way Hollywood, porn, and classmates make it out as if having a girlfriend and getting laid is the be all and end all. Fact of the matter is-- it's not as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be. Afterwards you're still you-- you're still going to put your pants on one leg at a time, like the same things, have the same emotional baggage. Sex won't change any of that-- all it will do is release the same endorphins as jacking off does. I get that you're frustrated, and I know how frustrating this is to hear, but you've still got a ton of your life ahead of you. You're fifteen-- the average life expectancy now is nearly 100.

"I'm not sure how old you are - I'm guessing late teens/early twenties, right? First things first: there's nothing wrong with you! Everything you do is *normal*. Just some things make you happy and other things don't. Some things make other people happy; other things don't. Your emotions are just mental explanations for your biochemistry. You may be producing a lot of testosterone; it might be some other type of hormone. One thing that is [apparently known](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-still-under-construction/index.shtml) is that the adolescent brain is undergoing a lot of changes right through the early 20s (and up to the early 30s), so don't expect it to last forever. There are many things you can do; one is to read up more on the brain, the mind and how it changes. If you look back through some of my posts, you'll see a few book recommendations. The best (as in *most helpful*) book I've ever read was *The Chimp Paradox*. The other thing is to perhaps engage in some basic meditative techniques; there are tons of free online courses in mindfulness. This helps you study what is actually happening in your body and allows you to identify triggers and deactivate them. The third thing is to talk to somebody about your temper. Talking cannot be underrated. Sometimes it leads the way to much greater clarity. Ignore anyone who tells you to vent your anger...research shows that this leads to greater anger in the future and establishes unhelpful patterns.

"Get yourself off benzo's, they feel kind of good and relaxing but the after-effects are awful. You will feel so much more clean and pure and real again when you get them out of your system. You must learn to channel your anger into something good. Draw grotesque, gory art. Make angry music. Write horror stories. Find a place to dump your anger into where something comes out the other end that can be appreciated by yourself or others. Instead of raging in public, try to practice polite assertiveness. When you get angry, just remember to save it for your anger output. Instead, handle the moment with calmness. Sometimes people will take a chance with you, say something forward that rubs you the wrong way. In our heads it feels like they had bad intentions or thoughts about us before saying it, but in reality sometimes people are just so caught up in their own stuff or not empathetic enough to realize what they just said. When it dawns on them through your calm communication how it just made you feel when they said/did that, you might really see a whole different side of a person that you'll just close away forever by raging at them. Give people a chance to make mistakes with you, and the good ones will grant you the same leniency.

"[Crossposted to a few subreddits] It was the winter of 2014. I had been living in the same loose grey shirt for months. I turned it inside out because the tags hurt my skin - and besides, no one would be looking at me if I went outside, so what did it matter if my shirt was on inside out. A pair of black sweatpants accompanied this. I had some nice clothes somewhere in the pile of laundry that had accumulated over the last six months. It was all I could do to put these pants on in the morning, to ease them and the shirt up over the undergarments I had barely managed to scrub up in the sink the night before. I used cold water because I wanted to feel something. These pants. They had a hole in each inner thigh where my weight gain had caused them to rub together. As long as I could wear a long enough coat to cover the holes, I didn't care. These things meant nothing to me, these pants with holes in them, this hair I barely brushed, teeth I rarely cleaned. I was Nothing, and I stared at screens and breathed, and ate and ate and ate. I was Nothing, and I would go out in the -35C weather without a hat or coat just to feel something. Just to try to feel something. But the snow and Winter herself knew that I was Nothing. Nature herself, who had always sheltered me, knew I was Nothing. I was less than death, for my death would at least return the molecules of my body to somewhere beautiful. But I was not beautiful. Not then and not ever. My window looked out on a fire escape. Years before, the voices in my sister's head had screamed at her that she needed to jump. So she did. She lived. The snow fell on the fire escape and made a thick crust. I would open the window to smell the air and think - what if. She did it. I could do it. It would be so easy. I would be free. Free of the echoes of all my mistakes, my failures, my weaknesses, my worthlessness, my Nothingness. The echoes that reverberated in all the remembrances of what I could've done, said, been, if I were a better person. If I were a person who knew how to live in the world. If I were a person who could share my feelings and life with others. But no, I am the frozen ice, the shattered snowflake, the drifting winter cloud. I climbed out onto the fire escape in the snow and I just stared. It was a grey cold day. No wind, no snow. I breathed and the air felt sharp in my lungs. My hands were cold. Winter was a blessing. The cold was a benediction, and somehow my frozen tears knew this. But how could you bless me? A death that was not true death? If I did it, I wouldn't die. I would just be badly injured. I knew something was wrong. I didn't mention my thoughts. There was no point - those around me would never have taken me seriously. ""You're just oversensitive,"" they probably would've said - because I am. So I said nothing. But I went to the doctor because the nothing I said was equal to the Nothing I felt inside, and I had nothing at all left to be. In my screen-staring catatonia I had managed to read about medication. I trudged to the walk-in clinic. I was afraid. I sat in the waiting room. I was afraid. I talked to the doctor. I was afraid. He was young and had kind eyes. I was afraid. ""I've heard Effexor works well,"" I offered. I was afraid. I knew it was one of the strongest medications - and I knew I wanted something strong and fast-acting. Side effects? I was afraid. But my fear of my soul's death was stronger than my fear of treatment, and so I took the pills. I was still catatonic. I still stood on the fire escape. I still stared out into the snow and let my hands freeze. I still wore the same inside-out grey shirt and tattered sweatpants. But I took the pills. I had a copy of Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. I took the pills. They gave me headaches and made me sleepy. I did a few exercises in the Feeling Good book. I took the pills. I did a few more exercises. Cheesy? Yes. But maybe the Nothing could be reshaped into something new. I kept taking the pills. I kept doing the exercises. The crying jags lessened. The loops of anxious obsessive thoughts slowed. Instead of standing on the fire escape and letting myself freeze, I took long walks beside the frozen river. I was alone, but my aloneness was a gentle insulating snowdrift - not a remnant of the icy Nothing I knew before. The bare trees made me feel something in their starkness. The air was sharp - and its crispness made me feel Real. My brain, my thoughts, my hopes, my dreams, they were Real, as real as the sharpness of Orion glittering over me at 4am. And Sirus trailing behind, my talisman of hope. The gentleness of winter was Real, the soft snowstorm on my face turning my Nothing into Something, a gratitude that I could taste the cold. It's been a year since I started taking Effexor. It's winter again, and it makes me smile. The cold and snow and ice remind me of the hope I feel for the future. The small and gentle hope - to live the life I want to live, however odd it may be, because I Want to Live.",2016,depression,1,0

I got sick in January, and got weighed at the doctor's. I was finally confronted with the fact that I was over 300 lbs. That was pretty crushing, as (years ago) I was really active and a healthy 170. After being depressed for a while after, I mustered up the energy to kick my own ass. I got myself in shape before, so why couldn't I do it again?

"Never think that admitting thoughts of suicide will get you in trouble. I suggest you see some sort of therapist. They don't have any power over you. You ultimately have the right to accept or refuse any medication. Also, a psychologist can't prescribe you any medication. It's going to take some searching to find a good therapist, but when you find one, it'll definitely help you. I've never heard of antidepressants making you stupid. It can and likely will affect your behavior, so I suppose it could make you do something ""stupid"", though that's a very vague term.",2016,depression,1,0

"I go through periods of this that last quite a while. Then periods like now when I'm kind of emotionally flat. Still suicidal thoughts and depression, but not feeling like crying every second. In fact when I do cry, it actually hurts and feels like it's being held back. Happened today. I couldn't get it all out. I didnt even get that feeling of relief or whatever you get after a good cry. Just a brief, 5 minutes of painful tears that felt like they were almost being torn from me. Then nothing again.",2016,depression,0,1

"It is the lighter version, even worse when I get to know someone on the internet and I am scared to see their IRL picture or hear their voice.

I wont speak on any channel (like phone) whom I dont really know being scared for my social anxiety talking symptoms coming around.

"Sounds like you got a shit hand. I can't say I can relate to most of it but I've been through my own shit and had the feeling of not having anything to look forward to. All I can tell you is you'll have nothing to look forward to until you have something to look forward to. Until then you've just got to take it one day at a time, one day you'll probably be looking back at this time of your life as something that you got through. Do you have anyone not involved in your family situation that you can talk to? I'm sure you spend a lot of time worrying about your mum and granddad, it would probably help to have someone to worry about you. A friend at school maybe? or someone on the other side of your family? If you really don't feel like you have anyone, feel free to PM me. I totally get the degree/job thing, I'm about to graduate with a fancy sounding degree but none of my family understands how hard/unlikely it is for people without at least a masters to get into the industry.

"This won't solve anything for me. I'm the kind of depressed that alcohol can't solve. Trying to fix thinfs gets me mad with false hope. In fact I fear Losing my depression for so ething much much worse. My privacy. I have always liked being lonely. I crave it. I font trust anyone and detest humanity so all I can do to make my life worthwhile is to be alone and unaffected to the world around me. If that is taken from me and I lose independency from fellow humans, I have nothing to live for. I wouldn't last long in such a world. If I see myself fit for suicide I know I will. At this point I hope I don't have to see myself fit it is still just a background noise which I don't really have to deal with. Sorry but I can't do this letter thing, to me it seems as if creating a dream and just a temporary relief by hiding into a delusion. I find reality much more comforting and it depresses me that people do not feel the same as I, and hide from realtiy. That is something which I can not, too. In all if I had to write a letter it would be just do as you have always done and keep believing in your unaltered self and don't be such a pussy making dumb letters you whining son of a bitch. I only fear Losing things because these are things I can not control I can not pretend to make a difference. I have nothing I want to change for myself furthermore, I am perfect.

"I'm sorry that all this is happening to you. College is a really stressful part of life, never mind also having to please your family members and dealing with deaths within the family. You are still grieving the loss of your grandma, which is completely understandable, and it makes it hard for you to care for your grandpa (which I believe is another added stress entirely). You shouldn't feel guilty for needing some extra time to process your grandma's passing -- harder said than done, but know that you aren't doing anything wrong by having difficulties caring for your grandpa. As for the problems with college, I'm with you 100%. I found myself diving head first into a degree that I thought I was going to love, but realized that I hated my classes and the family's expectations were forcing me to do something I didn't like. College can be great, but if you hate your classes and degree, it seems torturous. Don't focus too much on what your auntie wants you to do for college/a job.

Then you will be on sort of autopilot as you and other family members make final arrangements. Grieving for a deceased family member is difficult and usually takes several years for a person to emotionally come to terms with it. For the next couple of years, the holiday seasons from Thanksgiving thru New Year's will be sad. If you can find a grieving group therapy session, I would recommend it. I attended one for about 8 weeks and it can help in dealing with the turbulent emotions that you and your family members will likely encounter. Dealing with the sudden and unexpected passing of a family member is a real emotional shock.

"Hey. I know it seems like your life is always going to be this shitty. I understand that. But trust me, as someone who has gone through it, life usually gets significantly better after high school is over. The rest of your life will be nothing like it. Even college will be different. And try not to think about relationships too much right now -- most romantic relationships before your mid-twenties are kind of crappy. Spend as much time as you can on developing *yourself*, and finding out who you really are, not the drama involved in dating. As for cutting, I've also been there. I've been ""clean"" for about two years now. Starting was one of the worst things I ever did. It's terribly addictive. Even when you're feeling good, you'll want to cut. Then, before you know it, you have so many wounds that putting on clothes hurts and you have to put in extra effort to hide your skin. The best advice I can give you is just don't start.

"i first realized i had depression when i was about 12 years old and about a year later i threatened suicide in front of my brother. i was taken immediately to a therapist with my mom and was put on a prescription that ended up making me more depressed. at the time i knew deep down that i was sad, but i was still somewhat in denial about the fact i had full blown depression, i thought it was the prescription making it bad, or maybe it was puberty. Then in high school about 15 years old, i started cutting and burning myself and one of my only friends found out. turns out she cut herself too. it was the first time i had someone to truly connect with about depression and i thought i came to terms with it. fast forward to 19 years old, kicked out of my mothers, living in an apartment that was being evicted, drug problem, minimum wage job, food stamps fed me and my roommates, couldn't afford college even with FAFSA. So i joined the military and lied about being depressed. That worked, i was actually not depressed the military made me happy because it had given me so much more than i ever had. Now, today on new years eve i spend the day away from all family and friends with no celebration on a military base in BFE. i got in a fight with my spouse (who also suffers from depression) and its the first time I've been actually depressed in YEARS; i thought i was cured, i thought i never really was depressed. nope that fucking demon waited all this time to come out right during the holidays when i have no one.... anyway now i don't know what I'm going to do since you cant have depression in the military.

"I started seeing a clinical psychologist for what I thought was anxiety. After a couple sessions she suggested that I was showing many symptoms of major depressive disorder and advised I see a doctor about going onto an antidepressant. Well, I went and was placed onto an SSRI (Zoloft to be exact). After 2 days on this I responded miraculously. Then I developed psycho-motor agitation on day three. By day 5 auditory hallucinations (very minor however) began to occur. After a week I'd experienced a visual hallucination and a panic attack. Lastly an uncontrollable muscle tic in my neck began to make my life very uncomfortable. Even though emotionally I felt like superman I decided to return to the Doc. He made me fill out a questionnaire and I left with a Bipolar II diagnosis and a script for lamitrogien. Turns out there is a thing called the zoloft test (though it's only anecdotally recognised, it's not actually practiced as a medical test - this would be malpractice). People with bipolar are genetically inappropriate for SSRI's at least if not balanced with a mood stabilizer as they can force a manic/hypomanic episode. My shrink disagreed with the simple bipolar II diagnosis and sent me to a psychiatrist. One session with her and the general consensus is Bipolar NOS with high-functioning quiet type borderline personality disorder. This was obviously very upsetting at first but the lamitrogien has helped amazingly and I now longer feel like I am going mad when I come out of a depressive spell. I'd advise just starting with a GP consult and taking it from there. It may be financially difficult but in the long run it is completely worth it to get your mental health under control. Good luck and I truly hope you get the help you need. Edit - formatting",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

"I feel you 100% on the obsession with dying. Every day, whether it hits me when I wake up, when I go out, when I stay in, or when I go to sleep, some part of me drifts towards death. My therapist always makes me visualize worst case scenarios. It seems to help. The more you think about death (especially in absurd ways) the less important it seems. Just know you're not doomed. And I know that's hard to believe. I spend 90% of my waking life feeling the same way. You're not a lost cause. The very fact that you're reaching out for help on /r/depression proves this. You'd be surprised how much your family/friends would give of themselves to help you. And if they don't, feel free to message me with your problems. It's hard for people to understand depression if they've never gone through it themselves.

"I was in the same exact spot as you are when I was your age. Failure seems like an insurmountable obstacle that can kill you if make even the slightest mistake. But the truth is, no one will remember the failures you make today. It's hard to imagine right now, I know, but it's true. Middle school / high school / college are all prime times for making mistakes. Because no one will remember/care about them as time goes on. Everyone else is too busy making their own mistakes to notice yours. You're not going to know exactly who you are at this point, and that's 100% okay. You're surrounded by hundreds of people who also don't know who the hell the are or what they're going to do with their lives. Chances are, they're going to be completely different people in ten years, and so will you. Our failures don't hurt us, they only show us the ways in which we can grow. Be yourself.

"you should understand, almost everyone gets at least a little bit of social anxiety once in a while, its shyness, or just being in a new situation. The point when you cannot be comfortable around pretty much anyone, where you cant function in public, where your anxiety alters your life, that is when you have a social anxiety *disorder*. People with these disorders can barely sit in a classroom without freaking or getting extremely stressed and nervous. They cant form a relationship. Then again, everyone's different. Who knows. My SA has gone through stages the last couple years. It started as generalized anxiety and turned into extreme anxiety around females, then anxiety when sitting in the living room watching tv with family, or anxiety at work. I'd say if it doesnt significantly alter your life or decisions, like ""should I go to the store today, or on Monday because there will be less people there"" then you dont have SA.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0

On a related note, [this] (http://philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Philosophy%20And%20Depression.htm) mini-essay helped put a perspective on depression. I had a professor once who told me that depression gave people purpose. Terrible as it is, it teaches us empathy and gives us the tools to pull each other up. To recognize the suffering of others and channel our own suffering into mediums that lift our fellow men and women out of the pit. Whoever made those videos, amateur though they may be, have made somebody, somewhere's life better for watching them. And there's something beautiful about that fact.

I like to blame my older brother for making me into a shy, self conscious, nervous, basically I think of my self as a loser. My brother would bully me for anything which i think made me a quiet person and its difficult for me to keep a conversation longer than a minute. I was never really became a bully myself because I was afraid of the consequences at home from my parents but mostly my brother. He would always smack me across the head and threaten me with a beating so i had no choice but to obey, this gave me a lot of anger that i couldn't take out on anything the next strongest feeling was crying. I could go on about the rest of my young years from middle school to high school talking about why i hate 99% of people or how i dont have any friends, but i dont really feel like it not because whenever i try the other person just gets bored and i dont end up hearing from them again. No but mostly because its another new year spent alone at home curled up in bed because i have no working heater watching motivational videos and seeing a bunch of other sad saps (no offence to anyone) in worse or similar situations have made me feel like i should do something!

"When I'm feeling low and useless, I sometimes like to come to /r/depression, read some posts, and try and help someone who needs something I can provide. I'm a giver, rarely a taker, but what kills me is what little I can give others who need something. I come here, and just feel more useless about how little I relate to the causes of suffering here. My life is normal, I haven't lost anyone, or had this mental disorder from an incredibly young age. I think this post is the most impactful thing I've read in a long time. I find myself very similar to you, 22, single, alone, college undergrad. I personally went into mathematics, but that's another story. I too think about other dimensions, similar to string theory, but more focusing on the infinite different paths my life could have taken and their respective probablities. What if I left home 5 minutes later? What if I asked her out? What if I barely avoided death? Are my alternate selves fine? I never once thought to relate this thought pattern of mine to 5D, and respectively, variations of time to 4D (assuming that was what you meant). I didn't think of how time is a constant variable in our 3D, while in 2D, the Z-axis is the constant. Everytime I have these kinds of thoughts, I'm going to remember back to this tidbit of information, and consequently, I'll remember you. I also tried to fling myself from a building. To be fair, I was more in the planning stage, but I was making efforts to get everything in order. I was inspecting all the buildings on my campus, late at night, and seeing which might be high enough to kill me, and out of those, which had any doors that might be unlocked. Suddenly, I see a campus cop driving towards me. Fuck. I've got to come up with something quick. Before I could say anything, he just looks at me and says ""wanna see a snake?"" He then takes out a clear Starbucks cup with a tiny green snake in it. We then spent the next 15 minutes idly chatting about snakes and the weather and what not. Complete nonsense.

"What are you envisioning will happen that scares you? A psychologist is simply a counselor/therapist, most often a Certified Social Worker. Your first visit will be similar to a first visit to a doctor. They will give you a form to fill out. Name, date, insurance info(if you have it) what meds you are on and basic medical history. Often there is a check off list, have you had this disease? on and on. Have you had surgery? Etc. Then a line, Why are you here today? Briefly answer- Stress, Anxiety,Nightmares..........whatever applies to you. No need to go into detail on the form. When the counselor asks you in, you sit down. They sit down. ""So"", she says, ""What brings you here today?"" I am having a lot of anxiety in my life, especially at school....................or whatever your issue may be. ""Can you give me some examples?"" to which you reply. Basically you're only going to have a conversation with someone who deals with people who are struggling with emotional or mental health issues. The first appointment is no more than 'getting to know you'. It's easy. I promise. Take that leap of faith, despite your nervousness, and get started on learning how to deal with your issue.

No. I don't think you share the same thoughts as Elliot Rodger. Elliot Rodger was a narcissist who thought money and looks were all he needed to get women. From this post you sound like someone who is awkward and finds approaching people in general quite hard. You also seem overly negative. Also keep in mind Elliot Rodger only set out to get the 'hot' girls rather than trying to find an actual soulmate.

"My two cents on the discussion: (Background)~My mother had a mental breakdown when I was 16, I went to University at 18 so managed to 'get away' from it a bit during term time. My dad used to always tell me and my brother that my mother wasn't herself and we shouldn't take anything to heart when she was having an 'episode' - it was just her mental health problems, not herself. Got used to the screaming/shouting/paranoia... Often was accused of conspiring against her to get rid of her. We have not experienced a nice Christmas/New Years etc since 2011 - which is sad since it used to be an occasion for the whole family to get together and was something to look forward to. Anyway, to get to the point - I try hard not to blame her for how she is, however it is hard due to the toll it has taken on the family, particularly my dad. I personally have been dealing with my own issues, with anxiety, depression and have discussed the possibility of bipolar disorder with my doctor. All of which my mother has not a clue about because she has not asked after my wellbeing, nor is it something I could discuss with her. I understand this is a resentful tone, and though I try to be mindful of how she is feeling, it is hard to due to her unwillingness to get better. TL;DR: To some extent the actions and behaviour of people with mental health issues should not be held against them, however there is a line that should be drawn as to what is too far. Sorry if I rambled, just wanted to give an answer with background so that you could understand where I was coming from.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0
"The first session is typically called an intake, and it's SUPER laid back. The therapist just wants to get to know you.

But that's pretty much it. As a therapist I LOVE intakes. They're laid back, and you just basically chill for an hour and get to know someone. Afterwards, if you think therapy would be beneficial, you can schedule the next visit and go from there.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

"I agree that a person's mental illness doesn't excuse their awful behavior(s). I have personal experience as an ""offender"". I was diagnosed as Bipolar at around age 40. For about 19 years (age 16 to 35), my mental illness was undiagnosed, and then at age 35, I was misdiagnosed as having ""major depressive disorder"". I did not respond to the usual anti-depressants so the psychiatrist put me on a cocktail of different medications which triggered manic episodes. My current psychiatrist told me I was on ""rocket fuel"". Eventually the mania progressed to psychotic episodes. Without going into details, I did some crazy shit, which I can not share even with mental health professionals because they are ""mandated reporters"". What I did happened about 15 years ago, and I did NOT commit murder or sexual assault. In conclusion, I believe that I am 100% responsible for my actions, regardless of my mental illness, and the wrong medications which triggered the psychosis. Consequently, I have basically put myself into my own private prison because of my shame and my remorse. I can not forgive myself, and I don't expect anyone else to forgive me.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

"No, because Elliot Rodger saw his problems as being the fault of other people, not himself. From what he said in his videos, he saw himself as a nice, attractive guy, and the fact that women didn't show interest in him meant that THEY were bad. The very fact that you're considering the possibility that you're a bad person automatically means you are different from Elliot Rodger. As Lucy once told Charlie Brown, ""The mere fact that you realize you need help indicates that you are not too far gone."" After the Ila Vista shootings I too felt deeply concerned because some of Elliot Rodgers' words were thoughts I'd had almost verbatim. The one important difference was that I've always felt inferior to other people, like I was lonely because there was something wrong with me, not superior like Rodger did: &gt;You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime, because...I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman. I will punish all of you for it. He seemed to view himself as an Übermensch of sorts, Nietzsche's Superman, like murderers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb 90 years before him; perhaps as an emotional self-coping mechanism, he saw himself as a superior being, with others as lower life forms who didn't appreciate or respect his power, and thus he punished them for it. Such a superior individual would never question their superiority or wonder if they were bad. The very fact that you posted this shows that you are not a bad person.

"I've been on sertraline (100mg) for about 3 years now, and I have had no serious issues with it. My anxiety and depression have subsided to totally manageable levels and I can function relatively normally on a daily basis, which did not happen when I wasn't medicated. I am clear headed and feel like myself, which was the most important thing I wanted to maintain when I began taking any medicine. Despite all this, I can't ignore the fact that, when it comes to serious relationships with other people, I am totally absent. I have been in one long term relationship, one relationship that meant a lot to me (different person than the long term, and this relationship may have only meant a lot to me because there was some serious underlying addiction intertwined into it), and a few that arose out of me being irresponsible. Honestly, I became really good at emulating the emotions my partner wanted to see and I learned what to say and when to say it, but I never really had serious feelings for any of these people. I maintained questionable friendships during the relationahips, and definitely cheated during more than one. I was the one to end every relationship, and was never the person to initiate it from the beginning. It's not until now that I realize this may be a side effect of the medicine, not just me being irresponsible and not caring about hurting the people I had been involved with. All the same though, I was DEFINITELY irresponsible and doing stupid shit with no regard to anyone else, but it's been a constant in my life to fake it when it comes to loving someone, and these occurrences have overlapped the period in which I have been on sertraline.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

"Firstly, you really do not need to be worried about your English, if you think it's good then go for it. I think a part of the problem is lack of confidence speaking in English to others causing less confidence for yourself and it is a vicious cycle. To help with this you could look for groups of people within the UK city you are in who are from your home country, try meeting with them and talking to them in English and see if it helps. Find a small society you might find interesting and join that too. You also have access to your University's counsellors who are trained to deal with foreign students, they might be a good place to slowly get your confidence talking in English to them. Your post here is absolutely fine so it really is just a confidence issue. It does sound like your are having negative thoughts about yourself, lack of self-confidence breeds that idea that everyone is judging you. if you are able, contact the NHS (you should be registered via a University GP) for mental health treatment. It might take about a month to get seen and then have sessions every 2 weeks or so, but it really really helps. Hope this is helpful!

If you are feeling very anxious you could try a therapist.

"I don't think the diagnosis is important, particularly because it is quite offensive to undermine someone's illness. Either way, your roommate has some very specific preferences for your cleanliness, but does not seem to contribute to the household at all. I would recommend having a frank chat with them, perhaps over a letter if you think they might be overwhelmed or defensive. Tell them that you feel the amount they contribute is not fair. Perhaps suggest ways to compromise (ex. I can leave my laptop on the table but I will bundle up my cable on the floor if that makes you more comfortable). Adding to that, I would ask if they have a support system for their OCD. Professionals can be a huge help in helping people learn to manage their compulsions in a more realistic way.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0
"Getting rid of SA is a long process, you have to approach it step-by-step. There are fortunately many things you can do, such as controlled exposure, or trying CBT therapy (either in-person or online). You can also develop yourself within particular skills, on the basis that becoming a stronger person, that is - improving your sense of self worth through improving your abilities, will help you extend your comfort zone farther and farther away. Try learning about people's body language, some strategies about going through small talk, realize that your hobbies are great foundations for bonding with others, and if you don't have one - try to find it.

"Hey, I just want you to know that I understand what you are going through. I moved 4 years ago from Europe to the U.S. and started high school here. I too was fine back home, I had friends, and I didn't feel anxiety non- stop whenever I was outside. It was slightly easier for me because I spoke English without any accent or anything, because I'd live in the U.S. for 3 months each year due to my parent's work, but I think some awful experiences with people during my first few years of high school fucked me up. Now I basically feel the same as you. I'm scared people will think I'm a loner, lame, etc, and think that everyone is looking at me and judging me etc. Anyway it's important to not blame yourself for this. It's not your fault. The fact that you came here and shared this means that you want to change, and that's good. I'm not sure what mental healthcare is like in the UK, but you should try to talk to a psychologist to get help for your problems. Don't feel ashamed talking to a psychologist, think of them as medical doctors. You wouldn't feel ashamed to talk to a medical doctor about something in your body that's bothering you.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0

"I've noticed that when people see we're quiet and shy they take it as we're either stuck up or don't want to talk to them. It seems like they can't possibly believe that we want to talk and have a good time, but we just can't. As I always say, ""fake it till you make it"". First impressions really are a big deal. When you meet someone try your best to show them how excited you are to be there and to meet them. Hopefully they'll see that you're not trying to be rude or mean. I know it's hard to speak up when people take advantage of you and treat you like trash. The only way that's going to stop is if you speak up about it. A person told me once that when you break eye contact with someone that basically shows them that they have control over the conversation. So if you suddenly look down at your hands or try your best not to look at the person you're talking to you're handing over control to them.

It's the passivity and low-energy that I think other people find toxic. They sense uncomfortable silence around me and it starts to irritate them. Too bad how normal people are always so spur-in-the-moment and will tell you something like ""You're too quiet!"" or ""Don't you have a life?"" and don't realize it really hurts when you're in this position.

"Your roommate says he has ""OCD"" and many of the behaviors you describe fit the OCD diagnosis. Do you know if he is getting any professional help - therapy and/or medication? This is personal information, and depending on the duration and closeness of your relationship, he might not want to share with you if he is getting professional help. Putting aside whether or not your roommate has OCD for a moment, he sounds like he is a very difficult person to live with. I do not think that calling him out on his OCD and telling him to suck it up, or ""enabling"" his OCD, will improve your situation. In many cases, a person with a mental illness has NO clue or control with regard to how their behaviors are adversely affecting the person or people they are living with.

"Erm... Are you seeing a Therapist, or a psychologist? Just asking, as a therapy/councilor session will be very different to an assessment. A quick warning: an assessment can actually be quite confrontational, and one of the things which you may feel is happening is your worries and experienced are being down played. This isn't the intent of the assessor, but it can be an unintended outcome. An assessor's role isn't to make you feel better or even to begin treatment. It's to get at the nuts and bolts of any underlying or foundation issues. (Kind of: 'Never mind about the obsessive hand washing and your fear of germs, do you have psychotic thoughts or not and if so how bad are they?')

"Just have a casual discussion with your roommate the next time he or she asks you to do something unreasonable. Let your roommate know how you are feeling and why you think his or her request is unreasonable. There is no reason to make a big deal of it. All roommates get on each others' nerves, and the best way to stay civil when living with someone is to talk about things and work out any problems. It doesn't seem like it would be too hard to keep the conversation light hearted and non-accusatory, and to talk about things as these situations come up. It might also be helpful to have a more in-depth conversation if you feel the situation warrants it. Set some boundaries, lay down some ground rules, and talk about household chores/responsibilities. Ask your roommate not to touch or move your stuff without asking, unless he or she has a good for doing so. Let your roommate know that it makes you feel frustrated, angry, irritated, etc. to be ""mom""-ed all the time and that while you want to make your apartment an enjoyable space for him or her, you also have needs and are unhappy with the current living situation. Discuss some house rules for the common spaces so that *both* of you can use and feel comfortable in them. An example rule might be ""each roommate must do all of his or her dishes before midnight"". Ask about what you can do to hold up your half of the bargain and be a good roommate regarding organization/cleanliness. Talk about how you two will divide up bathroom/kitchen/etc chores in the future. As somebody with obsessive compulsive disorder, I think this sounds a bit more like OCPD more than OCD. Keep in mind that a diagnosis is just a label for a set of behaviors/feelings/thought patterns and doesn't change the nature of how your roommate is treating you. Sure, mental illness is tough to deal with, but that doesn't mean your roommate gets to order other people around or that you should be confined to your bedroom in your own home. Be supportive of their self diagnosis, but stand your ground. If your roommate complains about how you are aggravating their OCD or says you don't understand OCD, ask them to help you understand. Let them know that you are trying your best to be a good roommate, but also have certain ways that you like to do things and many of them are pretty normal/fairly reasonable behaviors (ex. keeping appliances/electronics plugged in, leaving a dish in the sink for ~4 hours, putting a bag on a chair in a common area).

"Sounds to me like your problem isn't anger, but rather the amusement you get out of making others suffer emotionally. Anger issues stem from *losing* control, not the opposite. I don't mean to pass judgement, whether it actually *is* a problem is something you need to determine, not me. But I do think the question you should be asking yourself isn't whether you have an anger problem, but rather whether the sense of satisfaction\amusement you get out of putting others on the edge is something that you are in control of - Is that urge for amusement at the expense of another something you can't resist, or is there a clear and particular reason for why you do it? Keeping your boss on edge, because he's a control freak is very different from keeping your boss on edge because you know his emotional weaknesses and you want to exploit them for the hell of it. It might also be worth asking whether you have any issues with empathizing with others - as a lack of empathy for the feelings of others is a strong indicator that you aren't in control of your urge to upset or anger others.",2016,Anger,1,0

"I can completely relate to how you are feeling. I actually start classes today. I've struggled with social anxiety ever since I graduated from high school. There have been many semesters where I have been put on academic probation due to failing a class for not attending. This not only sets me back academically, but financially as well. I'm going to graduate with way more debt than the average student from having to retake so many classes. It absolutely sucks and I just try my best not to think about it. When I graduated high school, I moved across the country because my dad had just retired from the military so my parents were moving and I was not ready to be on my own yet. So I know exactly how you feel when it comes to having no friends. I don't know anyone and I don't talk to anyone. One of my teachers advised me to seek help from services for students with disabilities. So I went and got a letter from my doctor and when I finally got the courage up to talk to someone about accommodations, I was told there was nothing they could do for me. I was humiliated. I'm supposed to see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly as recommended by my doctor, but it's practically impossible for me to gain the courage to go. I was thinking about trying the counseling services on my campus this semester so we'll see how that goes. I try to stick with mostly online classes, but the class I have today is a required class only offered online. I keep thinking about dropping it and taking it next semester, but I know I shouldn't. I hate those ice breaker activities. Not only do I get anxious, but the activity itself makes me feel like I'm 12. I know none of this is helpful for you, but just remember that you're not the only one who feels this way. School and work have been the hardest things for me to deal with due to my social anxiety. I can only hope that getting the courage to see a counselor regularly to deal with it will help me find out how to live with it. I'm on medication right now, but I know I need therapy to really get better. Best of luck. Hang in there and try to get the confidence to go to your school's counseling center.

"It depends on where you live (country). It may be that the other Dr has to show a visit with you in order to prescribe. In the US, there are strict laws on drugs - at least certain drugs. Some Dr's can proscribe and others can't. Some can prescribe certain med's but not others. I'm thinking the fee is the Dr's standard for an appt. but not for the med. It sounds like you live somewhere where it's not typical to pay for prescriptions, so I'm going with it's her office fee you are being asked to pay. I wouldn't pay it. That's basically two fees for one visit. Not your fault the Dr you are seeing can't give you what is needed. What happens next month? I'd find someone who can do all you need him/her to do.

"Social anxiety shouldn't be a barrier to your education. We all know college determines your future (whether you'll get a higher chance of getting a job, etc.). If there's anyone that bullies you, don't worry, I've been to that stage, too. I used to deal with social anxiety since elementary, but in Middle School I learned how to deal with people, and have developed my own style of socializing, and became a close friend of many in a group in High School. Think of education as a puzzle. How are you going to fit in? You solve it. Think of your high school education as a 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Everyone was NERVOUS when they entered High School. How did they fit in? They have no idea what to do there. So they started doing random things, until they realized patterns, solving a part of the cube. Then time came and they solved all of it. Now think of College as a 5x5 rubik's cube. Everything is harder now. But solving that cube always comes with a sweet reward: The reward of success. Now what is the lesson here? -You must try to do something. I was anxious as well, I was introverted, but that wasn't a reason to not socialize - at least socialize first in small groups. -If you get bullied, remember, bullies also have a problem. They can't help themselves from theirs (bullies might have a broken family, deceased loved one, psychological disorder, etc.) so they pick other people to make fun of.

"Sometimes unresolved issues/trauma from the past can be triggered or brought back up when we aren't expecting it. It's like our mind can only avoid so much until it's at its capacity and kind of makes us have to deal with it. Anger, in itself, is not a negative emotion. It's how we use/process or anger that can be seen as positive or negative. Anger is consider a secondary emotion meaning there are other feelings underneath the anger. It's super common to feel anger first because it kind of does what you are doing...helps put a protective barrier between us and the world even if we don't actually want that barrier. The first step to feeling/getting better is recognizing what's going on and you are already doing that which is awesome. There are lots of things you can do to get rid of these feelings but in my opinion finding someone to talk to is a good start. Heck you are finding people on here to talk to which is great! You mentioned you are in school so my suggestion is starting with a counselor at school. Whether you are in high school or university each school has someone.

"TL:DR, When you're the partner or loved one of someone with a mental illness, remember that it's a chemical imbalance, not the person you love. Pretend you're a scientist. Give yourself time to feel your feelings, then put them aside and get to work communicating and repairing your relationship. My husband has some behavioral issues due to bogus brain chemistry, and today was a hard day for us. Huge fight. Huge. He said something about the industry I work in that made me feel belittled and I made a sad face about it, he felt judged, and decided to let loose the gates of hell as we're sitting at the drop off area at the airport so I can go get on a flight for a business trip for a week. Hah. It was such an awful goodbye that it's laughable. Ps a good sense of humor helps greatly in these situations. I like to imagine that were Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston and I'm having an out of body experience watching the whole fight unfold. Anyway, people that suffer from psychological disorders often feel that they're judged unfairly, misunderstood and criticized by those closest to them. In turn, their loved ones feel neglected and, well, unloved. It's a catch 22. My husband's AdD causes constant distractions and emotional outbursts, which makes me feel unimportant and over time I become really sensitive, which makes him feel that he can't be himself. Rinse and repeat. My solution? Whenever we have an argument, I separate him from his actions. I like to think that there's a little gremlin in his brain that whenever sprinkled with the right mix of stress and chemicals, takes over like a puppeteer and makes him say and do things that are beyond his control. Now, the flip side to that is that he's incredibly aware of his situation and intelligent. He often has moments of clarity where he admits how much it holds him back personally and professionally. These moments are like shining lighthouses to me and I love them because it means progress. But when he recognizes that there are serious underlying medical issues that cause pain in our relationship and refuses to treat them even with the simplest do it yourself exercises, now that's unacceptable. That's where we're at now. Acknowledging the problem, but not doing anything about it. So, I step back, calm down, write down my whole mix of feelings (I often have several different reactions of empathy, anger, sadness, desire to help etc) have a couple bloody Mary's (2 deep at the moment) and chill until I'm calm enough to talk to him about it without being passive aggressive, mean or whatever. The person that doesn't suffer from the disorder needs to act like a clinician and before all else, listen. Then they can explain how they feel and hopefully make meaningful progress towards happiness. EDIT: You're not an awful person, but sometimes you might do hurtful things and you need to practice recognizing it in the moment or shortly after, and take responsibility for it.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

As someone who could confidently answer ""not at all"" to plenty questions, and then by answering ""enormous"" to other questions mean full blown panic attack-enormous... It's not a problem with the test per se, but maybe a disclaimer should be put somewhere on the page addressing that. * Not sure how the questions were chosen, but the main things that give me anxiety are all performance-based (meaning I feel like I personally have to perform well in some capacity), but not specifically while doing a task. Mostly to perform well socially in presentations, parties, dinners etc, so I answered ""moderate"" to *task-related* performance anxiety even though my social performance anxiety is/used to be crippling. * I can't eat in public or in the company of someone outside the closest circle without extreme anxiety, and I seem to recall this one from other tests...

I've been angry for years, however more holes in the wall and yelling at folks rather than rushing people and being physical. I recommend first seeing your usual doctor.

"I spent my entire last semester basically cooped up in my room, avoiding everything at all costs. I've also had a long winded relationship with Major Depressive Disorder (13 years to be exact). Here is my advice for you: Figure out what helps you *recharge*. Do you need to be alone after seeing a lot of people in a day? Or do you feel like you need to get out and socialize at the end of the day? Depending on which one of those you feel you are more like, this may indicate either why you are seemingly always cooped up, or why it is that you are struggling with being cooped up. Try not to force friendships to stay busy. Trust me, they're just more painful to try and maintain when you don't really care and you aren't finding that satisfaction you need. Find a hobby that you can do by yourself whether it's painting, drawing, cross stitching, running, cooking, yoga, reading, or whatever. It will burn time that you would otherwise be spending online.

What happened was I developed an obsession with the suffering of the world. I was fixated with the suffering of others and couldn't shake the thought that anyone who wasn't physically suffering, myself included, was to blame. I fought daily with the thought that any money I wasn't giving away to charity was causing the death of some poor person somewhere.

If she's not interested in you anymore, then it's still ok, there are a ton of other girls who would understand and accept the real you.

"Don't think much about friends, you don't need them. I am a 18 years old boy, I have no brothers, no cousins, and no friends. I don't talk to anyone pretty much, I hang out with bunch of people in my school, but I can't call them friends. At first I was upset and I always was thinking why I don't have real friends or brothers or even cousins, I don't have anyone to share my secrets with... hell.. I don't even tell anything to my parents, nothing at all... I just can't do it, they judge! and I don't feel comfortable telling them anything, believe it or not, I want to get out of this house ASAP! I know it's frustrating to be alone, to have no one to talk to.. no one to share your secrets with, your sadness, your happiness. but eventually you will get used to it, things that bother you? they are going to bother you for a while, but they'll eventually die inside you, you will become stronger. Being alone has it's perks, I have knowledge about almost everything, computers, websites, programming languages, servers, games, video editing, photo editing, etc...

"Hey, it will get better! Everyone got their weird points and tbh I don't think it is too bad to be the ""weird"" person, there is always someone who is more weird. As long as you stay nice and helpful. If your convo dies, try to ask the person something. People love talking about themselves. ""How was your weekend? What did you do for new years?"" or professional if possible. Asking questions helped me a lot. If you aren't distrupting someones work asking questions shouldn't be looked upon. Don't force a conversation, thats never good. Keep talking with them, you work there and you hopefully will work there a while. What do you do for lunch? If possible join someone. In my old company most social interaction happened in the smoke breaks (which were too often). So eventhough I HATE smoke I went with them, just to be a part of it. I don't think anyone avoids you on purpose and even if, just don't care. Social groups are normal and you don't have to be friend with everyone. Being the nice shy person isn't that bad, as long as you aren't the ""creep"". Staring might be a problem especially with female coworkers, what do you stare at? I do that too, I just honestly don't know where to look at but I try to avoid people. I am not sure if its a good idea to advice that, but i always have my mobile near me. Yes people that love their phones more than a conversation suck. Buuuut... it gets me out of uncomfortable situation. Dead conversation? Quick check of the smartphone. Nothing to look at? Quick check of the time. I don't know, it often enough gives me more time to say something or even the other person comes up with anything. A ""oh wow so late"" even stops awkward moments. Not your problem but I love my phone in social situation where I don't want to talk to anyone, people think you are busy. What is your job? If you have a desk, as stupid as it sounds, but maybe bring sweets? I notice everytime my coworker get sweets send from his mother (its more cute than weird) my boss spends much more time in our office and overall we talk more socially. I baked cookies this year and eventhough my mind was racing with ""what if they don't like it? will they say so? what if no one takes one?"" and so on, bringing them to work was actually nice and supposedly they were good. I am not sure if thats only me, but it got better in my job. The first weeks were horror, I never talked, I never looked at anyone, I just sit there and waited for someone to assign me work. But now this is like my ""safespace"" I know everyone, I know the office. I got really uneasy when someone new started and I am already panicing as I know I will get a new coworker soon.

This is my new mantra: In the end the only thing that matters is the FINAL GRADE at the end of the day the test does not care and does not reward all that social pressure you placed on yourself. I use that thought over and over, so that's what I focus on. As soon as the prof. starts talking make your mind focus on what they are saying, how it relates, asking yourself what the next step is, etc. FORCE yourself to focus on the task at hand, the most you can do about SA in that situation is to move the thoughts to NEUTRAL rather than positive (positive is not going to happen).

"Hey, friend. I'm sorry to hear about your sister's struggling. Some psych wards can be awful. I've had my share of experiences with rude, heartless workers. Do they not post a schedule of the times patient's are allowed to shower? Are all of the patients locked into their rooms, or just her/specific ones? She can ask for details about the medicine she's prescribed. Ask what it is, what it does, the name of it, etc. From my stays in psych wards I'm used to very briefly meeting with the psychiatrist assigned to me each day. I'm talking about seeing him/her for maybe about 10-15 minutes. Some places don't provide a therapist or even group therapy for patients. Do you live in the US. Is your sister a minor? Typically the laws in the US state that if a person is a danger to themselves (suicidal) or others then the person can be held involuntarily for 72 hours. In most cases the patient has the option for release after those three days, but in some situations the doctor will get approval for a longer hold. (Such as being held for two weeks.)",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

I had a very positive experience with SMART recovery, and I might have just had a very good facilitator, but with your mix of issues sounds like a good fit.

"I am 25, I live with my parents, I go to school part time but don't have a job as many days I just can't get myself to do things. I know its hard to ignore others that criticize you but they likely do it because they have issues they can't deal with and bullying is a way (bad way) to put the pain onto someone else. I find generally many people are annoying but helping others does make you feel better even if just for a moment and giving advice to others can at times be something that helps you as well. I also take wellbutrin along with lamotrigine and buspirone, I don't think drugs are the whole solution but I think you along with your psychiatrist should look at adding something to the wellbutrin as most antidepressants and mood stabilizers act on different neurotransmitters and wellbutrin only acts on one and is sort of its own class of antidepressant. Just by reading your post, which for being rushed and without finishing school is well written, I can tell you need something else to help with suicidal thoughts as until those go away life will be difficult. How could life not be difficult when you're suicidal, you wake up and your first thought is I want to die. Ive been there, and many days I still struggle with it but it is all about making improvements and trying to make the next day, or the next hour, or next minute better than the last.

I think a big issue is having your parents accept and be supportive of what you're going through and with that and their insurance get back on medication. I know it is hard to say without knowing your situation and parents but I don't see how anyone can not accept mental illness exists and anytime it involves suicidal ideation it is very serious. Would your parents be open to seeing a psychiatrist with you and that way the psychiatrist can explain to them how real this is, or have them watch a few documentaries. This is not a choice for you, if it was, you wouldn't choose to have voices telling you to hurt yourself. I am glad you recognize this, that's the most important part but getting the right help/medication is the only way to relieve it as after all this is not a choice, it's a serious condition.

"Get an automatic feeder for the cat. It's probably waking you up at that time for food, fortunately they learn real quick that the feeder gives them meals, not the humans. As for coping, I've found that expectations and awareness work. Expectations: Why get angry over a cat wanting food at night? That's exactly what you'd expect a cat to do. It's not the cat's fault it evolved to make them want food at that time. OR as another example: why get angry at bad drivers, what are you, surprised to find them on the road? Expecting these things takes the sting of the ""unfairness"" out of the situation. Awareness: At some level you probably realize getting angry over a cat gets you absolutely nothing and costs you a ton. Imagine if every time you got your cool you lost money and some of your health, that's basically what's going on.

"In no way am I saying she is getting the appropriate treatment, I couldnt know if she is or not but seeing as she was recently admitted it is not uncommon for the first few days that a person becomes more depressed in a psychiatric institution. It is a depressing place to be and all your control and choices you had before are taken away but the thing is, even if she is getting worse over the first few days or week she is as safe as she can be from causing harm to herself. Most of us need to hit rock bottom before we can start recovery and most of us, especially when we are involuntarily admitted will have trouble dealing with where they are, what got them there, not knowing for how long, etc. It is a lot to process especially for someone already in the midst of a mental health crisis. I imagine they may of yelled at her because it may be a safety concern if patients are doing things at times they shouldn't, obviously yelling is a poor way to deal with it but for someone who days earlier tried to hang themselves being alone in a shower could be concerning to staff if a schedule is not followed exactly. I think once you accept your situation you can begin recovery and that will lead to more leniency with staff as they see you making progress rather than just trying to keep you safe. I would say keep supporting her to improve by positively communicating with staff and doctors as it can be difficult to address the real problem with the proper medication without the patients cooperation and if they are not cooperating they may (right or wrong) give them medication that is more to tranquilize them and make them sleep such as benzodiazepine do rather than an appropriate antidepressant, mood stabilizer, etc that is much more helpful and many times life saving in the long run.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0

Taking these small steps could eventually help push you to be more outgoing in person. You can also get lessons/tips from professional coaches and experts and watch lots of helpful videos on how to overcome your fears. Plus, it's a forum with Q&amp;A and Clubs (like FB Groups), which makes it great for interacting...

First reaction is go into the dark room and hide in the corner. If and when I power through however, it comes back to norm and I even get a little high off the feeling of accomplishment sometimes. 4)Hard to self-describe. Can be all of the above and then some at one time or another. 5)Most likely improper introduction to social experiences as a kid by parents / grandparents / teachers. Being put on a spot, publicly shamed or humiliated can do this. As a side note - depression does make social anxiety much worse. 6)Noises - somewhat, light – very. 7)When I know exactly what I am doing. Be that public speaking or any other social environment that makes me anxious. Knowing what I am going to do or say beforehand makes anxiety level come down tremendously. 8)My friends and family are aware of this condition. 9)Occasionally 10)Since quitting smoking none at the moment 11)Deep childhood 12)Actually less anxious than in a somewhat familiar environment 13)It’s kind of a character trait that makes me – me. Sometimes I wish I did not have it, but most of the time I am ok with it as long I challenge myself from time to time to step out of the shell and not lose touch with outside world.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0
"I do not want to speculate about what he is going through, however I also have a friend who is struggling with his mental health. For my friend though we know what it is now, he's been ill for over a year. But in the beginning I was very lost, how could I have been so blind? How can I help him? What is bothering him? I imagine you are going thourgh something similiar, and what I can say is that there really is not point in blaming oneself. The best thing to do(for me at least) was just checking up with him sometimes, showing that I cared. If he is getting psychiatric care then I think being supportive and acceptive is the best thing to do. Every situation is different though, but I that was/is my experience with my friend at least.

"If you feel that way, it's most likely true. You can kind of tell when you're making other people uncomfortable, and especially if it's an office type environment, they are going to be talking about you. Try the best you can, but know that when you leave a room, people are usually going to say something about you and more than likely it won't be nice. As much as I wish it wasn't true, the real world is just an extension of high school. It's all about your social status, that's what really gets you ahead in life.

"1) Yup, I find it quite hard to even speak to my mother and when I do talk to her, it tends to be short answers. 2) Noone really, I just find it most comfortable when noone talks to me, though when someone is kind to me I end up feeling really guilty since I can never really bring myself to say ""thank you"". 3) Very self-concious, mainly about my voice since it's quite deep, I mumble and it;s just generally kinda hard to understand unless I talk fairly loudly - because of this I end up shaking, sweating, blushing and getting a very shaky voice. 4) Dunno really, I'm not really too interesting. 5) Got bullied frequently as a kid because I would stutter and wasn't able to pronounce certain letters / words. Plus I was constantly ignored in school and never really felt connected to anyone I did speak to. 6) I'm kind of sensitive to bright lights, but it's not really a big deal. 7) Short, one-on-one conversations with a stranger tend to not be *too* bad. 8) Tried talking to it about my mum, but she just doesn't seem to understand how bad it is, and to my few friends but there's not a whole lot they can do. I am seeing a psychiatrist just now though. 9) Yup, though I think that's more due to depression. I find it pretty hard to really enjoy anything anymore and I'm constantly tired. It's been years since I last had a good night's sleep. 10) Internet / gaming I guess. 11) Wasn't too big of a deal until about 4 years ago when everything just began to get too much for me. I was getting older and realising just how much my anxiety could hold me back from things such as a successful job, losing contact with friends and having the only girl I cared about reject me - those negative thoughts just built up more and more and made me less willing to socialise with people. 12) Sort of, but not for the social aspect, mainly just because I'm terrible with directions and get scared I'll end up becoming lost. 13) Well I'd honestly rather not talk to people at all, but sadly that's not something I'd be able to do, I'm only really wanting to get over this because teamwork is heavily required for the career hope to get involved in.

"1.) Yes. Even around family I still sometimes have the ""I don't know what to say"" syndrome but it's not as severe as when I'm talking to others 2.) I feel most uncomfortable around very lively, funny people because I feel like I have to match their level of funny or liveliness, which I can't. When I'm around those kind of people I just fade into the background. I say little to nothing because I either can't think of anything or the things I do think of are stupid and won't elicit the response I want. 4.) Honestly, I'm a lot of all of those. Adorable is the one that fits me least though. Envious describes me best. I never envy people for their possessions, I envy them for their character traits. I wish I could be the cool, gregarious, life of the party type that everyone likes to be around but I'm just a square guy at heart. 5.) I think the cause is just me not being outcome independent and relying too much on external approval. At first I use to relish in being alone, but that attitude was a defense mechanism. 6.) No 7.) I feel most comfortable when I'm around family. Everything else causes some anxiety even if slight. 8.) Not too often, no. I don't want to sound whiny and it seems like such a trivial that can be easily remedied if I just stopped being such a wimp. 9.) Lots of times, yeah. Other days I'm bursting with energy though. 10.) Nothing in particular except thinking. I overanalyze every interaction I have with everyone, especially people I am emotionally invested in. 12.) This new wave of social anxiety just began recently. I'm pretty sure it coincided with a recent infatuation I've developed. 13.) Not as much, no, unless I'm thinking about earlier situations in which case I feel anxious over how ""not-cool"" I was. 14.) I want to be better. Deep down there's some part of me that believes I can be cool, be assertive, interesting and socially attractive. But as soon as I start to convince myself of that, my everyday interactions reinforce my doubts. I do want a pet. I'm just not in a position to own one yet.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0

If you want more elaborate answers from me, feel free to PM me. I'd be more than happy to share. Thanks in advance. A little about me. Male, mid-twenties &gt; 1) No I don't think so. I'm embarrassed to express myself in front of my mom. Before my dad pasted away I didn't share much with him other than stuff like doing homework and heading over to a friend's house. &gt; 2) I don't like being around confident people. It make me feel like they're a used car salesman and I'm being conned. I also have trouble with people with accents. If they're culture is different than mine I feel like I cannot relate and I become awkward. I feel comfortable around sincere/quiet/level-headed people. I can deal with strangers one-on-one because they don't know me yet and I think that's a good thing. &gt; 3) I become quiet. I just look around and wait for someone to ask me something. If they don't talk to me then I won't talk to them. I'll stare at my phone then eventually leave the situation. &gt; 4) depressed/creepy. I act foolish to try to hide my true feelings sometimes. &gt; 5) I've been overweight all my life so bullying in school/no friends. My dad also had no friends when I was growing up. He was sick and didn't get around much. My parents never really socialized with other parents. I also don't know my extended family. &gt; 6) I get startled easily. Loud noises can startle me. &gt; 7) There a few people (about 3 total) that I've known for a long time. I'm opening up to them and I don't feel anxious around them. Also if we're talking about a topic I know a lot about I feel less anxious. &gt; 8) I'm opening up to my close group of 3 now &gt; 9) Yes most days. I'm overweight and depressed. I also screwed up my life by taking a job that eats up all my free time. &gt; 10) Eating/food in general &gt; 11) Elementary school. Being picked on and not being included. It's now grown into an issue where I like to be the center of attention. &gt; 12) Yes I could feel anxious if there is a large group of people that I don't know. If it's one-on-one I can deal with strangers. &gt; 13) I hate pets and I don't want any. Yes I want to overcome my social anxiety enough to get a girlfriend. If I have a support group behind me I feel confident and less socially awkward. I want a gf that can introduce me to new people, place, ideas, etc.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0
"1) Depends. It's a little worse when I'm with my parents but better when I'm with my sister. 2) Worse- definitely extroverts. Loud-mouths that love cracking jokes all the time. I hate being around them. On the contrary, quiet but confident people seem the best for my anxiety. 3) Well... I get very sweaty, I blush, and I turn into a blubbering moron who can't finish complete sentences. I usually tough it out or freeze. 4) Patient, serious, depressed, boring, creepy, gentle 5) I think withdrawing from people slowly but gradually during teenage depression to the point where I had no more standing connections besides my family probably contributed. I just grew more and more quiet over time until I didn't speak anymore. That and unfamiliar locations at all make me feel less secure. 6) Yes, and yes. 7) When I'm around my sister, someone else is doing the talking, or it's a large group where if I don't participate no one will notice. 8) Uhh... I tried with a therapist but it didn't go over too well, I made no progress and he gave up on me because I was missing too many appointments. 9) Yes. 10) Reddit and Youtube. It's not dominating my life or anything though they're just my two main pasttimes. 11) End of 7th grade. I got addicted to a computer game and became a shut in for the entire summer and didn't see any of my friends. Hahaha. Beggining of 8th grade was fine but things slowly went downhill until I hit rock bottom in May. 12) Yes. Well, it depends. Like here on the Internet I'm fine (except 1-1 talks, I never do those and thus have no online friends) but in a situation where I know I won't see anyone there ever again it's slightly less bad. Not to the point where I'm gonna talk or anything though. 13) At heart, yes, but currently I'm too depressed and I think people are scum and don't want any personal connections anyway. I'll be fine with a decent pet or AI. I hope this helped your project and I have to say I quite enjoyed talking about myself, hahahaha.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0
"1) Yes, with my Grandparents. I'm not sure why but it's probably because my visits usually involve me talking to both of them about what I'm been up to recently whilst they listen intently. Speaking in front of an audience has always made me incredibly socially anxious. 2) I feel most comfortable around people who are easy going and encouraging I would say. People who make an effort to make me feel at ease. Normally I feel more anxious around people who intimidate me due to my low self esteem. This includes anyone I deem to be cooler, more intelligent, better looking, more confident or just out of my league socially or physically in any way. This includes most women I encounter. 3) I get the usual symptoms, increased heart rate, shaky voice, inability to speak clearly, mind going blank. Depending on the situation I would usually try and back out if I could to save myself the embarrassment but these days I'm better at coping with it and have developed techniques to keep my SA under control as much as possible. 4) Kind, patient, creative, open-minded, eccentric, intelligent, gullible and inquisitive. 5) Pretty much all of my SA can be traced back to low self esteem, which in itself is the result of a range of factors including my upbringing, bullying at a young age, my appearance (looking much younger than my age and being quite short), social awkwardness, my introverted personality, having more niche nerdy interests (mostly as a kid) and lack of experience with women. 6) I am quite jumpy and easily startled. 7) When in the company of close friends I feel the least anxious as I feel I can relax and be myself without judgement. 8) Yes, over the past year I opened up to a lot of my friends who have all been incredibly supportive and have helped me work through my problems every step of the way. I wouldn't have made so much progress with my SA if it wasn't for them and am lucky to have such an amazing support network in my life. I've also spoken to my doctor who has helped me understand SA from a medical point of view. How anxiety affects the brain and what happens to my body when anxiety is triggered. This has also proved invaluable in the fight to overcome SA. Don't ever be afraid to seek professional help. SA is a valid medical condition and is treatable. 9) No actually I feel like I have too much energy for the most part and often struggle to contain it. I'm a chronic overthinker by nature and my mannerisms are often quite frantic at times. I used to be really clumsy and also made a fair amount of impulsive but ill-thought-out decisions as a result of not taking my time and thinking things through. Based on my behaviour it would seem that when my anxiety flares up my body panics and starts frantically looking for a solution instead of slowing down and letting the information sink in. 10) I wouldn't say I have an addictive personality, only that I have always had a habit of over analysing things which has prevented me from living in the moment. However by accepting that this is just a part of my personality I have been able to relax more and actually start to use it to my advantage in some ways. 11) At school when I started to realise that being myself was somehow a source of ridicule and judgement from my peers and even some family members. Because I instinctively believed what everyone said about me was true I started to develop an inferiority complex about myself that is still ingrained in my psyche to this day. 12) It varies from place to place but mostly yes. 13) Not only do I want to overcome my SA, I actually AM overcoming my SA as we speak. It's been a long and arduous journey but by committing myself to the task and working through all the issues I mentioned above step by step I've been able to slowly but surely undo the damage done from my younger years. I've still got a long road ahead but I think I can confidently say that SA no longer has control over my life and that alone is something worth celebrating. If you've managed to get this far into this essay of a response then you deserve a medal. The biggest piece of advice I can offer anyone with SA is this: Focus on the little victories, these are the real signs of overcoming SA. Even if you mess up 9 times of out 10 it's that 1 moment of success that PROVES it is possible to be the person you want to be. You just need to figure out what it takes to be that person more often which takes time and practise. Really try to understand your anxiety and yourself, it will seem much less intimating once you do. Talk to others about it and get as much support as you can. Push yourself to get out of your comfort zone once in a while, you'll be amazed at what you're capable of, believe me. If I can do it then TRUST ME anyone can. Hope this answers your questions, OP. I'm a 24 year old male postgraduate and from my experience it gets easier as you get older.",2016,socialanxiety,1,0
"&gt;I don't know if she is vocalising hurt or genuinely feeling aprehensive. I would guess probably both. No one wants to live with that kind of raging and insensitivity and selfishness.

"I don't understand why your psychiatrist insists that you just stop taking the Risperdone without tapering. I am Bipolar and I have taken anti-psychotic medications such as Risperdal, Seroquel, and Fanapt. I have never taken Abilify. When I go off all anti-psychotics, my manic episodes tend to increase, and the mania sometimes becomes psychosis. I used to have no trouble falling asleep at night, but the anti-anxiety medication I have taken for many years, Clonazepam, no longer has the same sedative effect. I don't want to increase the Clonazepam because it is a benzodiazepine, and I am already addicted to it. The psychiatrist says I am physically dependent on it, not addicted, but I don't see much of a difference between physical dependence and addiction. I would avoid taking any ""benzos"". I take a natural medicine called ""melatonin"" to help me fall asleep, but it does not help very much. I recommend trying the ""melatonin"" - it works for a lot of people and it might work for you.

There are apps for diaphragmatic breathing which may help, or you could look up instructions on diaphragmatic breathing. The breathing will help you stay calm, and hopefully because you've planned what to start with you can get started without stressing too much.

I taught English to a classroom full of foreign students where I often had to sing, perform skits, act crazy, etc. While that ""performing"" was difficult... it was almost easier than these normal situations. So, like you, I was wondering if I could apply this to my life. So what I've started to do is kind of ""perform"" in everyday situations. Instead of just being plain old me timidly talking on the phone, I would pretend I was someone strong and well-spoken, almost like I was a character in a play or movie. And it kind of does help! I don't know if it is a good thing to kind of assume a new identity around people, but it can help you be more outgoing in my experience. One other thing I might suggest is joining an online practice site. There's a website called [SpeakMeister.com](http://www.speakmeister.com) that has free video challenges you can do where you can feedback from other users. That way, you can get comfortable speaking in front of others and maybe be less anxious in public? It sounds scary, but it's a lot less scarier than jumping into public situations right away! You can also get lessons/tips from professional coaches and watch lots of helpful videos on how to overcome your fears. Plus, it's a forum with Q&amp;A and Clubs (like FB Groups), which makes it great for interacting... and there's even video chat if you still wanted to talk with people that way! Check out their [specific Social Anxiety Forum here](http://speakmeister.com/clubs/6/). Anyway, I hope some of my rambling helps you!",2016,socialanxiety,1,0

"Thank you very much for this ! Especially for going into that much detail about the concrete steps you took, very useful. And it's great to know that this work actually paid off, as sometimes I'm dubious whether self-help techniques actually work. I think I'm somewhere in the middle wrt really believing those ideas. I'm hoping I can convince myself further. &gt; When I really first got the type of thing I wrote above, I would spend at least an hour a day just typing my ideas out and trying to make them as concrete as possible. I would think of new examples and related ideas throughout the day and put them in my phone. I would make a point to try to challenge every idea I came up with as much as I could, and not move on until I felt I had successfully defended it. I am very motivated to think as accurately as possible and gain as many insights about how things really are as I can. I've found that so many mental health problems are simply caused by inaccurate beliefs. So I strive to always make my list of inaccurate beliefs smaller and smaller as time goes on. This is very interesting. I've been thinking about doing something similar for a while. Feels a bit overwhelming so far but I'll try to get to it.

"Hey so I'm no psychiatrist or doctor so I'm going to not offer any advice about medication. But let's start a dialogue. You see a psychiatrist- do you see a therapist? Do you have any one you completely can divulge all your fears and thoughts and problems and hang ups to, that will help you through them and get to a better place with them then you are now? A pill can only do so much, and yes they can have benefits for certain people, but maybe you should look in to some other options than just pill. It's a hard road facing your issues but if you spend time with it, keep up with a therapist, even if you feel uncomfortable at times because they're making you take a hard look at things you wouldn't on your own, but you can seriously change your entire life naturally and healthfully with this route. It sounds like you have some issues from home, with your mother and probably beyond. This is a good place to start with a therapist; you might not even realize your own ""normal"" is not necessarily normal to everyone else, if you don't discuss it with anyone.",2016,mentalhealth,1,0
"There are some areas in my life where I'm somewhat reckless but anxiety has also crept into a bunch of areas. I'm not really scared of animals (except for scorpions) and I've handled wild rattlesnakes with my bare hands before, I don't have anxiety when I'm driving, and I've got my car well over 100 mph without really worrying about anything when it was relatively safe to do so. But there are things where I feel anxiety where I didn't used to. Like taking tests, I get massive anxiety about tests in my last 2 years of college where in high school I actually looked forward to tests. Certain noises will send my heart racing because I've had to deal with a lot of emergencies with my dad and with my dogs over the last 5 years. Even cooking gives me a bit of anxiety when I try something new because I don't want to fuck it up.

"I know mine was partially through my mother. She is a ticking bomb ready to go off when she's not overly happy and kind. I remember when I started high-school I had just had a year without living at home (sort of a post-middle-school thing in Denmark) and had developed really, really much and I really got out of my shell, but then living at home again I think I must've become depressed and my mom's unpredictable emotions would just tire me out. I remember the first months I was slightly anxious but otherwise outgoing and how I had become over that year, but some days I would have fights with mom or she'd be pissed off about something hypocritical and i'd end up feeling powerless after hours of shouting. I remember coming to school one day and I was just down and totally bummed out but trying to hide it under my usual way of being but one girl laughed and said ""Linkenski, you look so sad, lol!"" and it just hit me. I was fucking sad, my life was shit. I think my crippling social anxiety has developed out of trying to hide my problems since then. To be clear, I've had anxiety-like things since somewhere in middle school but that post-school year took me out of it almost completely, but then coming back to live at home again it just reocurred and developed further until half a year ago when I moved out, but it's been 5 extra years of living home before that and I've seen everyone live normal lives around me and struggle to care about anything anymore. I'm always just hiding what's really on my mind when I'm amongst others and I no longer function at all... spend most days in my flat, even skip 1-2 days of school every week. I guess I believe that if your closest surroundings like your family, isn't a place where you can feel good everything in life just seems harder.

"Eat by yourself at a restaurant during the dead times/days. Then gradually go when it's busier and sit at the bar. The bartenders are friendly, so eventually strike up a conversation. Go to the mall when it isnt busy and window shop, say hello at first (and a ""thank you,but I'm just looking"" will help prevent the social awkwardness of casual confrontation) but then start having conversation with the employees when interested when you gain enough confidence to do it. The key here is to go to the same places until you've worked up enough confidence to explore new places. Make friends with your local hole-in-the-wall restaurant owners.

"I used to be a firm believer in medications. I saw a psychologist for help with coping mechanisms for my depression and anxiety and that did help, but as far as I was concerned meds were the only thing that would really cut the mustard and you'd be an idiot not to take them. This is despite the fact that it took my psychiatrist and I 15 years to find a combination that actually worked, and the side effects were such that I would only take the bare minimum to limp through life. The last time I tried to go off my meds 4 months ago it was pretty horrific. 3 months ago I stumbled upon an obscure treatment model that involved, of all things, large doses of specific vitamin and mineral supplements. I was skeptical about this but actually gave it a try. I was totally unprepared for the dramatic results that I had, such that I've now been almost 2 months since I took the last of my meds and I can now confidently say that I'm cured although I'm going to have to take these supplements for the rest of my life. What I'm saying is that apart from psychological/meditative techniques, there are non-drug alternatives out there although you have to really look for them. The fact is that the treatment I recieve is not recognised by mainstream medicine and is therefore not covered by government rebates or subsidies. Tests and supplements are expensive, but for me it's worth it because of the lack of side effects and the fact that the severe vitamin and mineral shortage was impacting my general as well as my mental health.

"It may be helpful to approach this whole thing from a slightly different angle. It took me a long time to realize that people (generally speaking) don't mean it in a bad way if they leave in a conversation when there's no more talking. A lot of people just assume the conversation is over and naturally move on. It's something people like us tend to have a problem realizing (especially when our goal is to prolong the conversation). Something that has helped me personally is to accept that conversations can ""randomly"" die out, and allowing them to do that. I try my best to not think bad about someone for leaving, always giving them the benefit of the doubt. Another thing I learned the hard way is the fact that trying to keep conversations going for the heck of it rarely produces a desirable result. You may actually end up annoying some people by trying too hard, and often the conversations become stale or boring for the other person (who presumably is not under heavy anxiety-induced stress). An important thing in fighting our condition is, in my opinion, learning to let go. I wish you all the best, man. I've been there for about 10 years, I know how much it sucks. Just keep in mind that change starts in your mind and it IS possible. I don't know how far along the road to improvement you are, but one of the first things I did was to read, read, read.

I guess what I'm saying is that loud, depending on the reason for the incident, may not be a disproportionate response. Anger, in and of itself, is not an unnatural or even unhealthy thing - some things should make you angry. It really comes down to questions like this: 1. How angry would another have been in my situation? 2. If I were watching myself as a neutral third-party observer (a fly on the wall, if you will), what would I have thought of myself? Would I seem justified in my response, or would I seem unhinged and irrational? It's not easy to be objective about yourself, but it's worth striving for (just don't trust it *too* much). As for the hospital - we're not doctors in here (that I'm aware of), so as a non-medically trained person, I'd say this - if you feel like you cannot calm down, heart racing, thoughts racing, etc., even after some time has passed, yes, you should seek some form of medical assistance. Regardless of treatment for your physical symptoms, you should also consider speaking with a certified mental health practitioner, and discussing your behavior with them.",2016,Anger,1,0

"I don't know that I have a solution for you, but I do have a kinda similar experience I'll share. Way back during Christmas of 2012, I started my least favorite tradition, which is my Christmas-Time Meltdown. I've repeated it ever since, and it's getting old for me fast. Probably for my family as well. At any rate, my family has some similar characteristics to your girlfriend's family. Whenever someone leaves the room, there's talk about what's wrong with them and what they need to do to be a better person or more successful or.... I don't even know what. My dad likes to talk, to the point where, ""do we have any milk left"" can turn into a two hour long speech that roams from the milk to the ethics of factory farming to the state of affairs with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Naturally, my siblings and my mother have all been the subject of a speech or two about what they do and don't do that upsets him, and I figured out at a young age that there had to be speeches about me that I just wasn't around to hear. My sisters are similar in that, but not all of their ridicule is behind my back. I'm well aware that I'm the least accomplished member of my family-- dad had a pretty darned impressive career, mom more or less ran half the public school system in my town growing up, one sister is happily married and expecting a kid and one of the top math teachers in her State, and my other sister graduated cum laude from Stanford to work for NASA, the army, and now Lockheed Martin's space division. I don't have half of any of that going for me. I smack shit with hammers until it works again. In 2012, I was struggling to maintain a C average as I graduated college with no real world work experience and desperately struggled to pretend that my relationship with my then girlfriend wasn't falling apart when it clearly was. At any rate, I had a bit of a meltdown and talked to my mother about it because-- well, she's my mother. She'd always been the least judgmental, so she was the easiest to talk to about my concerns and my inferiority complex. Or reality. No idea if it's that I ""come down hard on myself"" like some people try to claim or if I really just don't measure up to everyone else. Kinda feel like it's the second one most Christmases, though. Regardless, it was an emotional conversation. For reference, I'm a pretty big, hairy guy, and I cried for probably the first time since I was 9 or so. It was just good to finally get that stuff that had been bothering me since I was a child off my chest. It didn't fix things-- I still tried to kill myself a few months later as more stuff in my life took a southward turn-- but I think it helped. I repaired some of my relationships with my mother at any rate, and it's helped to make interacting with my family a little less painful. Still feels like a kidney punch when my sister talks about how easy it is to find a new job that pays $100K per year and looks at me like I've got a fixation on something crazy when I keep pointing out that there's a big-ass difference between straight As at Stanford with experience working for NASA and a C average with a tiny little Midwest school and experience with a no-name little company hitting fairly simple machines with hammers until they work again, but it's better. To summarize: if there's someone in either family that you think you can talk to about this stutt, try talking it out. It sounds stupid, and I never would have believed it before I actually did it, but letting those emotions out will make you feel better. Not immediately and not all at once when it finally happens, but you'll just sort of notice one day that it's been a while since the last time that weighed heavy on your mind, and that's a good thing.",2016,Anger,1,0
"I have this happen occasionally. While I haven't found a way to completely shake it off (I find I spend the whole day feeling 'off' at best), I do find it easier to recognise that my day has been affected, and to try and do things to distract me and improve my mood, while avoiding things that are likely to make things worse. Typically this means trying to lose myself in TV, movies, a book or a video game. Also, for the rest of that day, whenever I find something making me angry or irritated, I remind myself that it's probably not as bad as it seems, that I'm just in a bad headspace. Particularly when I find I'm getting angry with someone, as they probably haven't done anything, or at least nothing bad enough to justify my feelings at the time.",2016,Anger,1,0

Like a muscle I have been able to take just flashes and turn them to moments. You will get there too if you work at it, little by little like everything else unfortunately. The next step for me was that once I wasnt AS clouded by anger, the moments i had were sometimes followed with shitty feelings. I started to feel foolish when I looked back at my life; all the friendships I ruined, opportunities i wrecked, all the times the people I lost my temper in front of probably whispered psycho to each other as I walked way. All the parties and good times I ~~may have been~~ was excluded from because nobody wants to be around a guy with a quick temper. So you see, its just another mental trap. I just try to remember you cant change the past either way so look forward. I have been where you are before and you can build on these feelings and expand them.

If you're not playing with friends (on voice or something), pretend you are. You wouldn't do this where someone could see your face, you wouldn't want your friends to misunderstand your anger issues and start to avoid you, so use that ""fear"" to push yourself in the right direction. 4.

"You recognize that compliant and withdrawn is a mismatched response with abuse and anger is mismatched with your current situation, which is presumably not abusive. I'll tell you what I found and you can decide if it feels right to you. As a kid, I actually was furious and outraged at the abuse, but it was impotent rage and expressing it in any way only made the situation worse for me, so I learned to push it down and ignore it. The problem is that it was actually legitimate anger. The purpose of anger is to destroy injustice or prevent harm, but as a kid I wasn't capable of either - hence the abuse. But it was still there and it was still real and instead of directing it where it belonged (at my abusers) I directed it at myself in the form of ""Why are you so weak?"" ""Whey do you let this bother you?"" ""What's wrong with me for being so upset all the time?"" Years of carrying around all that anger and pushing it down and before I know it anger is leaking out all over the place. It boils over at family, at friends, at coworkers, even at strangers. The thing is, if that anger wasn't in me and already close to the surface, I wouldn't have to worry about it coming out inappropriately (i.e., when there is no injustice or imminent harm). So the key was to let it go where it belonged and really allow myself to feel the rage, pain, sorry, disappointment, betrayal, and thorough injustice and harm of the abuse and point that anger where it belongs, at the abuser (emotionally speaking, though possibly not literally in a physical way) and let it go. As I've learned to allow all the emotions to do their jobs I've learned I'm much more emotionally capable and competent than I'd ever realized. Depression, shame, and addiction are being replaced by connection, joy, and ambition. It's almost hard to understand, but there are a few key emotions that work in really simple ways, but are capable of absolutely wreaking havoc if not listened to or allowed to do their jobs. It's perfectly normal to feel anger, but since you never learned to allow it in a healthy and normal way (due to your unhealthy and abnormal situation growing up) you have to go back and learn it now.

"Hey man! I hope you're doing better today. I've been there more than once, I've seen that fear on my loved one's eyes. I've felt that rush. But then I've felt that emptiness and regret too. On my case, it was due to years of emotional abuse, partially my family, partially my ex-wife. Until that moment came and I blew up. Now, I never laid hands on anybody, but seeing what you're capable of is a very damn thin line. First off, look for your triggers, what sets you off and something to counter balance it. We can't go thru life avoiding to blow up while we keep doing things that will do that. Many times, after an argument, I'd walk out and would take a stroll by myself. Then when I got a hold of it, would go back into my place. I stopped the anger that way. After a messy divorce, I dated someone much younger, sadly enough, never realized she had very different outlook in life and tried to see things my way. Well, as you can imagine, that didn't work out. So I got bursts of anger in a very different way. I self-checked and found ways to control myself. Sadly, that relationship is now over, but it wasn't because of my anger. So I thank her for the love she gave me. After you learn about yourself, try to look for a therapist, one that won't try to shove you into anger management, but would try to find out what's bugging you. AM will teach you how to stop, but they are not personalized to all their attendants. So a 1-on-1 will do wonders for you. If you found the one you want to spend your life with, talk to her about your anger, that will tell her how much you care and together you can find ways to deal with that. There will always be something that sets you off and you won't enjoy a relationship if you mark your path to follow to get there. But finding ways to, again, counter act when that happens. I remember feeling a lot better when my last gif would run her fingers thru my hair while laying on her lap. Not when I was mad, but at any moment you're having a quality time. Gave me that ""I love you"" feeling I sadly didn't have when I was a kid. Don't let the worst of you lose the best of what you have. Stay strong brother.",2016,Anger,1,0

"I'm at college but I have/ had a similar problem. The girls in my class were so fucking annoying and they have no respect for any of my teachers. For example they would talk when the teacher is talking, not move when the teacher asked them to move, smoke e-cigarettes in class, come in really late so that it was pointless even attending. They really pissed me off so much and I couldn't deal with it. One lesson I had to leave out of frustration so I asked to go to the bathroom. I got there and kicked the shit out of the cubical. It was a bad idea but I just got to the tipping point. I think that I can relate somehow on the subject of people that are below my level. I see people as pawns and I'm the king. The way I deal with bullshit is I see myself as the top and everyone who is a dick is at the very bottom. Even though this is how I think I do feel that if your job is to talk to people on a daily basis it shouldn't be under discussion with anyone around the workplace. Your colleagues should find new things to discuss other than somebody being 'difficult'. Next time that happens tell the bitch to shut the fuck up but leave curse words out of it. Overall conclusion you just sound pretty frustrated with some of the people you work with. Ignore it to be honest because making it a problem will affect your life in the longrun.

"I know exactly what you're explaining. I've always been slightly less empathetic than most people. When I was younger this manifested itself as anger and violence. I fantasized about tearing apart people who pissed me off in glorious detail. For me it stems from my mom who was always angry and used me as a way to physically vent her frustration. I grew up thinking that was the norm. I eventually got into a lot of trouble and realised I needed to change myself if I didn't want to end up incarcerated. I have several ideas that work for me. One important thing is to realise what a huge gap there is between wanting to hurt and actually hurting someone. It's similar to how someone might feel extremely tempted to jump or push another person of a very high cliff. Though the brain tricks you into believing you would actually do it, and it may feel very real, the chances are very slim. Personally, I occasionally allow myself to indulge in my fantasies of hurting people in extremely annoying cases because I know it's harmless and I have no true logical motivation to do it. On the other hand, indulging in your anger one time makes it easier to do the next time. Venting anger in this way actually increases how often you are likely to feel angry and makes it more tempting. Two is to just not care everything. Seriously, just switch off. Like the other guy said, these people are boring, inconsequential apes just like everyone else and you have no reason to bother getting angry over their stupidity. Normally if I'm really struggling to calm down I think of a completely bare room or dripping water or some other zen shit like that. Three is a decision you have absolute control over. I have no idea how to get this to make sense but try to imagine you are that person. If they are stupid and selfish and hypocritical then imagine you are too. They can't comprehend those facts just like ants can't comprehend that they are ants and therefore how can they be accountable for their actions? They don't know how idiotic their actions are and they never will because they lack the skills needed for that self-evaluation. Four is, if all else fails, get good at being annoying. Learning how to get on people's nerves when I needed to was my greatest saviour. For instance, if you had flashed that woman in the car a smug smile, you may have had the satiafaction of her feeling pissed at you instead of the other way around. In trying circumstances I find my relief in making other people annoyed instead. It is very satisfying to have someone who was rude to you be the one who gets angry, whilst you look on in calm, smug observation. Five is, most importantly, seek therapy if this is disrupting your life. Sure, therapists can be annoying too, but therapy is the best place possible to vent your frustration whilst also constructively finding solutions, rather than destructively taking impulsive risks and actions. Again though, it's entirely your call.",2016,Anger,1,0
"Sometimes when I'm irrationally angry about something, it is rooted in an irrational belief that I've never questioned. For instance, I often get frustrated with my kids for not cleaning their rooms. It's irrational because all my main issues are met - it is clean enough to vaccuum, no food is rotting away, etc. but it still pisses me off because they don't voluntarily keep it organized. There are lots of reasons that the expectation is unrealistic - they've got too much stuff to manage it easily, they are comfortable the way it is, they don't want to spend their time cleaning if they don't have to, they're not really old enough to care that much etc. But, my parents didn't think that it was an unrealistic expectation and used to give me grief all the time about my messy room. It feels like that's what parents are supposed to do to me, that I'm supposed to be all over them to clean their room. I have to remind myself about what's really important here, what's my goal, and how am I going to achieve that. Yelling doesn't help, insults don't help, clear, reasonable expectations and a plan to help them meet those goals is how we get there. So now we all clean 15 minutes a day, doesn't matter where unless I specify. I still want to be mad about it sometimes, but I do my best to stick to the plan, I remind myself of what I want (calm, confident, happy kids &amp; family) daily, and I remind myself what we're doing to get there (loving, guiding, working out solutions instead of finding problems, easing up a lot). THere's stuff that triggers me, especially money stuff, so I have to be especially careful. While I'm taking a deep breath, I remind myself that we have enough money, that my relationships are more important than money, and that I don't have to figure out how to pay for this right now I just have to deal with the problem. Money really makes me panic, then I freak right out if I haven't gotten on top of it already. idk if any of that helps, hope something resonates!",2016,Anger,1,0
"First, the fact that you mentioned all the things you do tells me that you're not feeling appreciated for doing those things. You may be falling into the trap of being too nice. Doing things for people doesn't actually buy you anything. If I give you a hot dog, you don’t automatically owe me a dollar. Second, I'm almost positive that the ""one word"" is more likely the final bit of disrespect in a long line of difficult actions. I'd guess there's a lot of things that your brother has done that you don't like. So... Assuming that the above is true, I'd suggest that you get the fuck away. Let them know that your actions scared you and you need some time. Make plans to escape the situation, and let your brother pay his own way for a bit. If you're in a toxic relationship, it will poison any attempt to change. Especially when the others in the situation are benefitting from it. So stop taking care of others and take care of yourself.

"Hey man, from a younger brother I can tell you this. He may be in a rebel phase, he could be acting like that because he has lived under your shadow/rules. In my house, after my dad passed away, my oldest brother took over and what he said was the golden rule, the rest of us had to comply. I got to that point, especially when he had a few beers, which wasn't often, I would be the biggest asshole. But writing it down the way you did, shows how much you care for him. A viscious circle doesn't always have to be repeated. You show you don't want to be like that. Talk to the dude and tell him how you feel, maybe a one-on-one, maybe a family meeting, but also giving him responsibilities will make him understand how you see things. Make him pay a bill or buy groceries every so often. That will change his view. And yeah, like the other dude said, take some time for yourself. It will help you calm. Sadly if the problems escalate, you could hurt him bad or even worst and nothing could fix that. Don't lose faith on him and practice meditation or something to help you cope with stress.",2016,Anger,1,0

"Flavortown, one of the single most important aspects of being a man is self-control. Without that, you remain a child. This punk you speak of cannot take your self-control away from you, it's something you would have to give him. Don't let him have it. When this punk starts to push your buttons, remember that you have matured farther and faster than he has, and that your ability to control your anger is a very clear indication of that. When you distance yourself from his taunts, you win. He, on the other hand, will begin to look like a fool. So I would suggest that you simply tell him that you're not interested in dealing with his behavior, and then turn your attention away. I know it's hard, but you can do it.",2016,Anger,1,0

There's always gonna be someone making life miserable for the rest of the guys. So don't let that get to your head. Most of my work life has been at machine shops. So lots of dudes just trying to be the alpha. I used to take it head on, got into altercations at many different places. After showing I was not gonna let them walk over me. I'd just focus on myself. Even the bosses were part of that at times. I'm not telling you go and get them tiger, but I'm just saying you can create your workspace. Even if you're shoulder to shoulder with somebody. Take your time off and leave work at work. You don't get paid to think about it when you're at home. If you can, jam some music or wear headphones. If not, just follow your beat.

"You are none of those things. Did a parent or someone else treat you in such a way or call you things to make you believe that? Listen, the first step here may not be to join a boxing gym (although I might suggest it, yes). The first step is to develop a better internal dialogue toward yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. I know this feeling, and we are the same- we are our own worst enemies. Really. No one thinks those things about you. But ironically, the more we think them the more it will manifest in our behavior and other people will think it through what we say, our body language, etc. the answer is to not over compensate through aggressive acts, but to learn how to be nicer to yourself. Trust me, I wasted many years pretending to be someone I was not, and so did my mom, because deep down inside we were (and I still am) insecure. So please, see a therapist or pick up a self help book, write down things about yourself that you like. Remember how you don't have to be harsh on yourself. That's a lie, told by weak minded people. The truly strong people-the ones who don't give up-can maintain their sense of wonder and love for themselves and others, at least on the overall. We all have shitty thoughts about ourselves too.

"Speak to your parents buddy. Approximately 9 hours ago, I was feeling very, very down and suicidal, about total misunderstandings and misreading things that were said/happened over Christmas. I was racking my brain for hours, how I was going to ask my brother about those things that had been plaguing me since then. I got it into my head that my brother would kick off on the phone, saying something like ""how dare you think of us like that."" He caught me off guard whilst I was planning what to say, and he phoned me, so just said what I had to say, but asked him not to be angry before hand. I also explained that what I had to ask him may seem trivial even stupid. You know what buddy? It turns out that neither him, his wife or their son meant the things that I though they had, with the way they looked at me when I said whatever, or what they meant when they said whatever. And I'm 44, and it's still very difficult for me. But don't let that make you think that it's all gonna be bad, even by my age. Chances are it won't. Hang in there and tell your parents. I have Asperger's, and so, social situations are extremely difficult for me. In the end, all was sorted, I apologised, and we said ""happy New Year"" to each other, and with that said, that saw the end of 2016. Don't worry about a phone, I know you don't know me, but I have shit loads of spare phones if you want one. You matter, not material objects.

"You're shooting yourself in the foot saying 2017 isn't going to be good when not even the whole world is on Jan 1 yet. You say you'll be disappointed with all that you won't accomplish then go on to say you're just going to do nothing and waste time. How can you be disappointed when you give absolutely zero effort? Disappointment is reserved for actual let downs, not things that don't miraculously go well. Yes, you can't just push your depression aside and kick ass like no one's business, but you have to try *something*. Depression wants you to do nothing because that's what it feeds on, and the longer you sit and sulk, the worse it'll get. You need to reveal your worth to yourself. You have potential, don't waste it telling yourself it's not enough. People will tell you time and time again that you're worth it, but it's not this depressed version that has worth. The person you *could* be if you set every fiber of your being on 'Go' is worth it. You *can* do great things, but you need to see that you're capable.

"I've been sitting here for around an hour now, wondering how in the world I was going to start this comment. Thinking to myself, ""No, that's a shit way to start."" or ""What if someone I know recognized my username and started mocking me about what I was saying."" Even as I write this, I think to myself, ""Why would anyone be interested in what you have to say?"" or the one time m dad told me, (Once was all he needed) ""Man up."" And with that I think to myself ""Guys shouldn't cry"" or ""Guys don't talk about feelings and get emotional."" I guess what I'm trying to say is that I understand the inferiority that you feel. The feeling of ""I need to be the best at everything, or I am nothing."" Now, I'm not going to say that I know exactly what you are going through because I don't. I also don't want to sound like I have it worse therefore you shouldn't have anything to complain about. (I've had people say to me plenty of times that they understand what I'm going through and all that crap, but when I ask them to describe it they either can't or just repeat what I said to them. I've also had people try to ""one up"" my issues like a fucking game to see who's life is shittier and who should shut up because the other has it worse. Either that or they just straight up tell me, ""There are others who have it worse than you."" and I hate it more than anything so it's the last thing I would want to do to someone else.) I recently graduated from high school and I am living at my parents house still, I constantly think to myself everyday, ""Look at you, sitting here day after day, playing games watching movies and browsing the internet. Useless."", ""You don't have a job, nor do you help around the house hardly ever. You just sit here wasting everyone's time and money."" My best friend from when I stared school up to when I got to high school was great. We did everything together whenever we could. It was great. When we got to high school however, I started to talk to him about certain things that bothered me or that I was struggling with. He started to ""one up"" me one shitty things that happened to him and didn't care about my problems at all. Once he got a group of friends who liked to smoke, drink, skate, steal etc. He only ever called me if all of his other friends were busy. And stupid me, I would always oblige thinking that maybe one day he would actually enjoy my company again. I started to think that he never actually wanted me around even when we were younger. Just the thought that someone could just dump a friend off like that after 6-7 years like nothing infuriated me, and killed me. The possibility that I was just ""filler"" that whole time was absolutely heartbreaking to me. From then on, I tried to fit in the best I could with whoever I could. Even if we had nothing in common I, just wanted people to appreciate me, for real this time. So I started to try to be the best at everything. If someone liked sports, I had to be the best at that so they might accept me, did they appreciate someone with good grades? Had to be the best at that too. I started to hang around with people I didn't even like just to be accepted, constantly worrying that they would just leave me in the blink of an eye. Through the years I found some friends that I actually liked to be around and felt (reasonably) comfortable with. But they always moved away. It had started my obsession with being someone I wasn't. It was who I was now. I can't even remember how it felt to be me. My thoughts are always scattered and fragmented and there are times when I literally can't form thoughts that even make sense to me. Trying to speak to people is difficult because I have no idea what to say or even how to say it because I'm trying to think of what they want to hear rather than what I would say. I am so distracted with trying to fit in, I literally don't know what kind of person I am. Am I nice? Am I loud? Am I annoying? Am I thoughtful? All of the shit I've had thrown at me used to make me sad and lonely and that became a normal feeling. Recently, it's been either I feel nothing or I feel hatred towards anything, everything. Hatred, thinking that I deserve all of this, but why? What the actual fuck did I do to feel like this. Most of my hatred however is directed at god (if there is one). My mom is religious and so took me to church when I was younger. Didn't think to much on the concept of god mostly because the people attending that church were all cunts so I just assumed that all Christians were that way. Later though about half way through high school, I thought I found my ""salvation"" so to speak. I had found people that I really enjoyed being around (still nervous around though). It was a youth group organized through two churches, one nearby and one out of town. It was a small group of people who I could have thoughtful conversations with. It was the only thing really worth living for. I thought to myself, ""If this is what being a christian is all about, count me in."" I would pray to god go to church, the works. After a few months, however, most of the people there had graduated and moved off to University or College and the majority of the group was replaced with a bunch of loud, annoying 10-14 year olds. I was utterly destroyed yet again. It was all back to normal now. I started to blame god for everything, started to build up all of my hatred towards everything. I've built up so much hatred for god and life that I get so unbelievably angry at everything that annoys me. Now the only thing that makes me even remotely happy is the escape that games provide. It's not enough but it's something. Every time something goes wrong in game (aside from if an enemy kills me or something) I get infuriated. For example if my internet is suddenly slow and I can't play a game that requires internet connection or if my game crashes I get so angry it's ridiculous sometimes leading to fits of rage telling god to die. I think the reason is that, I feel as though god has taken so much from me including my entire personality that I have to feel protective of what Good thing I have left. That being games. I'm sorry this got a little off track from my original statement about relating to your sense of inferiority compared to others. Sorry if this seems like more of a rant than anything. I hope you could follow all of it without much difficulty. Like I said, it's been difficult for me to even form sensible thoughts never mind explaining something to someone else. I'm also not sure how this would help in anyway, but I felt the need to post here. Edit: Sorry for the wall of text too.",2017,depression,1,0

"I started talking to a counselor first. It was hard to open up (and it was also hard for me to figure out why and what I was feeling) and after around 4 or 5 months of counseling I started seeing a psychiatrist. By that point it was easier for me to talk to the psychiatrist because I learned to open up with the counselor more. I got meds and I'm feeling better now, but a little different? I don't feel much emotions anymore and it's really hard for me to trust people now. But I think being able to open up is an important thing. They might be able to help you learn how to deal and handle your feelings, and I think once I was able to open up I felt a bit better since I didn't feel as if I had to hold everything in.",2017,depression,1,0

Happy New Year! From one lurker to another.,2017,socialanxiety,0,1
"So I've spent a lot of time reading and thinking about this subject and over the last year or two my mood has improved significantly (I'd consider myself happy maybe 70-80% of the time). First you need to understand what makes you unhappy and generally, unhappiness comes from three sources. The first way is that your brain just isn't producing or maintaining enough of the chemicals that make you happy. This is persistent unhappiness and is due to a systematic problem that needs to be fixed. We usually just label it depression, but there are a myriad of things that can cause this. Drug and alcohol abuse are common ways to screw up your brain. When you exercise or have sex, your body endogenously produces some feel good chemicals. The system that regulates this has evolved for thousands and thousands of years and will not overdose your brain on these feel good chemicals. When you're pouring in chemicals from an external source, there is basically no way to regulate the dosage so it is very easy to go above whatever limit would be considered safe. Having persistent sleep issues that have no apparent source or feeling anxious or sad ALL the time, then you should visit a doctor as that may be the only way to fix this type of problem. The second source of unhappiness can be equally persistent but is due to a problem with perception. A common example is being unhappy with your appearance. To be unhappy about how you look, you have to first put a high value on physical appearance, have some pre-existing ideal of beauty and be rating yourself as uglier than your ideal. It is a good thing to care about how we look since we use looks to quickly judge people we don't know. But how much do YOU actually value looks when it comes to the people you spend your time with and care about? It is probably not at the top of your list. There is no reason to think it would be at the top of everyone else's, so perhaps you are overvaluing the importance of how you look. Additionally, your ideal version of beauty is completely subjective. You may look fine to others and this is the goal of putting time in to your appearance, so there is no problem here. The last thing that can lead to unhappiness is inaction. If you're in a bad relationship and it is causing you misery, the problem isn't going to fix itself. You gotta get out of there. Similarly, if you're single and in a rut, sittting around at home isn't going to fix your problem. Go out and meet some people. If you're upset with yourself for not eating healthy, change up your habits. In general when trying to diagnose some source of unhappiness, always analyze your situation objectively and ask yourself why you feel a certain way. Don't stop at ""I feel ugly"" or ""I feel lonely"". Ask yourself why you feel ugly or lonely and keep going until you have a plan in place to fix your problems. If there is nothing you can do, you need to adjust your expectations to meet reality (this usually happens naturally over time, but actively accepting your situation can help speed up the process). Therapy helps here. If there is something you can do, make a plan and do it. Don't think about it.",2017,depression,1,0
"Hey there. 20 year old girl here. I remember the anxiety of being 18 and needing to fix everything right away and freaking out about relationships. But, two years later, I've learned a valuable lesson. No other human being is going to make you happier than you can make yourself. And besides. What's wrong with being alone? I hope you think about it a little. Maybe learn to love your own company because for now, it's what you have. Not always going to be the case of course. I promise. But for now, breathe. Life is one big process. The process is happening as you read this. I promise that too. :) Happy new years.",2017,depression,1,0
"Hit the gym, save some money, move out. Even if you have to move out with a friend or an acquaintance you still learn something and you gain your freedom. Don't be afraid that if you live with someone you hate it will suck. I'm not saying that there isn't a possibility that it won't suck, I'm just saying it's worth the experience and freedom right? You'll meet some people, get your endorphins flowing from working out, and learn some real world skills (like how to find a place in society that may help you feel apart of something.) If you wanna move out you have to make some changes to whatever lifestyle you're living that prohibits it. It's not gonna be easy either. You have to work for it. Maybe go out to an event (bar, show, social gathering of any sort) every couple weeks or so and work up from there. Meet some people, pick up some more hours at your job, and get in shape. There's a lot of simple improvements that if you make them habits can benefit you so much. The best thing for me when I'm dealing with my depression and anxiety is to realize that there is nothing to be afraid of and that the world isn't going to crash around me into a million tiny pieces if I make a mistake.

"Not sure where people come up with the idea that therapists have all of these severe clients with all of these devastating problems, but the truth is that the majority of clients are pretty middle-of-the-road like you when it comes to symptom severity. The rule of thumb is that if it's a problem for you and it's inferring with your ability to function or affecting your quality of life, then by all means seek help for it. I also don't know if people realIze that therapists get paid to help people-- it's a job, not a volunteer position. So I have no clue why people feel like seeking us out for help is a burden. It's a burden to put your problems onto your significant other or your friends for an extended period of time, but helping people sort out their problems is literally the job of a therapist, and one that we are trained to handle. Lastly, why people think that they are somehow a ""stronger"" person if they don't seek help for mental problems is beyond me. Would you say, ""Well, I have a broken leg with the bone sticking out, but I think that I can make it on my own and that doctors have patients with 'real' problems so I should be able to handle this on my own""? Not to mention that it's very insulting to people that do have the courage to seek help-- THAT'S being a strong person.

Really off putting and kept me from pursuing it for a long time. Let me be clear - this doesn't stop the dissociation. I never found a way to do that. It just changes your perception of it. However, perception is reality and dissociation is no longer a problem for me. The reality is that you ARE a spectator to your emotions. If you can get that out of your head then thats all well and good and you won't need to pursue mindfulness. My anxiety riddled mind hyperfocuses on anything that bothers me and therefore the only path was through it. Anxiety medications are effective but the side effects can disturb your quality of life. That doesn't mean I am against them. You can be too distressed to pursue effective solutions to your problems. Popping a pill to fix that so that you can actually do so is wise, as long as you don't view them as a permanent solution if other remedies are possible. Take the medicine, feel better, work on yourself and your problems, handle them, come off the medications.",2017,mentalhealth,0,1

"I would love to be comfortable on a dance floor (and particularly around women in that situation). Over the last year I've been really getting into techno and house music, which I find to be pure bliss in its own right. And I'm learning and collecting the necessary equipment to make it myself, and that's something I feel very confident about and would never think twice about if I was ""good enough,"" if that makes sense. I mean I haven't even produced a whole song yet, but I don't have any serious doubts about my capacity for it and I'm super happy to know that 2017 will be the year I start releasing music for public consumption! But then on the flip side, I'm having a really tough time getting out of the anxiety loops I put myself into whenever I go to music events. For all of my musical ability, I have a disappointingly poor 0% natural talent with dancing. I've actively avoided dancing my entire life, but now all of a sudden, my love for EDM means it comes along with this horrible obligation. And it's like I hate myself when I see all these beautiful girls waiting for someone to dance with and I pretend not to notice and just withdraw from the situation, but I also fucking hate myself when I start dancing around people and they either actually laugh at me or I imagine that that must be what's happening (and I know that both regularly happen which makes it tricky). And it's weird because on one hand I have 0 interest in dancing so in theory it shouldn't matter to me that I can't do it, but on the other, I don't want to deprive myself of the amazing music and the opportunity to meet incredibly enticing women just because of my social anxiety Tl;Dr: I'm a remarkably bad dancer despite my musical interests normally associated with dancing.

"I'll speak from my experience. I was depressed and rather numb as well when I sought help. Therapy helped, significantly, although my therapist eventually determined he could not do any more for me and referred me to a psychiatrist. Therapy did not change my subconscious, it helped me manage my thoughts and develop behavioral strategies. My therapist and I talked in detail about irrational thoughts, why I have them, and how to challenge them. I think it's also important that therapy didn't end with the office visits, it was something I had and have to apply daily. It can be a lot of work sometimes. On the relationship front, my therapist helped me to keep perspective on what my family was observing in me. I resented their comments and reactions a lot less, and this helped me not to give spiteful responses. It also helped me work through my resentment towards friends for daring to ask me to go out and do something. I am calmer in knowing it's okay to say no sometimes and I can think more rationally about accepting invitations and pushing myself. I stuck with the therapist I initially saw, so I can't really help on finding the right one, I just liked him and his manner. Therapy is expensive, I can't deny that. I'm in the US with high deductible health insurance; using a health savings account helps. How I viewed it was I was paying for more than just the hour, but all the time I was using what I'd learned. Good luck, you can figure this out.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

Or better yet, go ask out a bunch of random girls first. You'll likely get turned down a lot. But you'll get some practice in and will learn to deal with rejection.

"Look, I understand how you feel. I attempted suicide 5 or 6 times when I was 14. I was going through homelessness, living with family I barely knew, family making me feel like shit because I came out as bi, and other things I don't feel like bringing up. I almost died the last time and was institutionalized. After I got over my muck I felt horrible. And like you, fear that I could actually have died is what kept me going. I also struggled with severe depression and anxiety, now controlled but thats another story for another day. You feel guilty and scared as hell, but you learn to manage. You can't undo what you did but you learn from it. I learned that had I died, I admittedly wouldn't have gone through some of the absolute hell I had. But I also wouldn't have gone through some amazing things, met amazing people, and got father in life than I thought at 14. All you can do is move on and carry yourself forward. Learn from the person who hurt you and learn from what you've done. Lifes a messed up educational game. You learn, you fall, you fuck up, you get back up, you dust yourself off, and you move on and repeat and the next time you fall you get back up sooner and smoother. I might not be the best person to give advice but I went through a period where death was what I desired most and I learned from it.

"So therapy is way more of an art than a science, so it's really hard to just say ""Here's what is going to happen and what it'll do to you"". I had one useless therapist, one so-so one, and two that I got a lot of progress with. And all four had really different methodologies. Dr Drew talks how half of therapy is just sitting down with someone, learning what it feels like to be comfortable and uncriticized, and then share your true self with them. Half of the progress you'll get is just in learning how to bond with another person. Many of us have never had this, and are stuck in a constant ""If I share my true thoughts, I'll get attacked"". The huge progress I've made is when I am able to understand my underlying thought process, I.E. I always had SA and felt bad talking to people or using up their time, but it wasn't until a really specific interaction that I uncovered this direct ""If I make a mistake, the other person judges me badly, then they leave, then I feel unlovable and worthless"". I never could have understood that process without the help of an objective third party. In regards to crying, the first time I went in with a ""I never feel emotions, I used to joke with coworkers about us being dead on the inside, no clue why I don't enjoy things or feel sad ever"" and as soon as I sat down and made eye contact with him, I burst into tears. It was kind of funny looking back, but I just spent so long with no real personal contact, no one interested in me personally, no actual human interaction with depth. It was kind of shocking but made me certain that I had an actual problem that I needed to work on. The problem with your questions, is that imagine asking them about a car mechanic. If you know your car isn't working right, you find someone who is trained to help, and you pay them to help. You do want to get your money's worth, and you do want to make sure they are competent, but there's often no way to do so without trying them. It's a hard thing. I had to take on an idea of ""This is a doctor, I'm just going to show up there, put myself in his hands, tell him what is wrong, and do whatever he said"" and turns out therapy doesn't really work like that, but it helped. Let me know if you could use any other info/encouragement.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

I've been hospitalized in psych wards at least thirty times, and even recently spent some time in a mental hospital. I've only in the past year regained my will to live. From what I've learned through all of this is this: those thoughts, thoughts that you'd be better off dead, thoughts that everyone is better off without you, thoughts of hurting yourself, they're just that: thoughts.

If you can think of the people who are there around you and still want to die at the same time then i say professional help is needed. but who am i to give someone mental health advice without a licence, just off experience.",2017,mentalhealth,0,1

"They are supposed to be supportive and helpful, a good therapist shouldn't negate your feelings. Your feelings exactly why you want someone to talk to. I see one for anxiety, and we spend most of the time talking about what's made me anxious since the last time we talked, and how to feel a little less anxious in the future. You're probably your harshest critic, so if the therapist ever says something along the lines of ""you're wrong,"" they're probably telling you the feelings you have ARE normal and valid. That's possibly the best part of seeing a therapist, you get someone in your life that validates your feelings, and helps you deal with them.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0
"Go back to therapy!! You are a perfect candidate for therapy, please get help. If you find a therapist that isn't helping you, try a new therapist. Repeat until one works. Don't give up. Fight for your right to be well. I am so sorry your life has not been kind to you. No one should have to feel this way, but we have to deal with the consequences anyway. See if you can get back on meds. If not, you'll want to give your body and mind the best chance it can to fight depression and that is in keeping yourself healthy in all other ways. Nutrition, exercise, sleep, socializing, productivity. Meditation is always good too. One thing to know: depression brain doesn't know what's good for it and must be ignored and we must act in the opposite way. It will say "" hanging out with people sounds terrible"" but if we go out and have fun we will actually feel better. Depression is the disease where you just have to do the things that feel impossible to do, no biggie! /sarcasm You already know wrestling helps keep it at bay. GOOD!! Don't stop!! Exercise is crucial in staving off depression and you've got that covered. (Lactic acid directly impacts the part of your brain your depression messes with- motivation). Eat nutritious food. Learn what makes your mood feel better by watching how categories of food make your feel- carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and fiber. High sugar diets are known for making depression really bad. Indeed, if I eat junk food too much for too long my mood is destroyed. I fix it by eating something with tons of veggies, spices, and ingredients in general. Pay attention and you'll see the connection. Socialize: make sure to have good times with friends regularly. Even good interactions with strangers can make one feel connected. Sleep good: don't miss a good nights sleep or your brain will be too much of a mess to keep itself together. Productivity: by getting things done we feel empowered, and depression is a disease of powerlessness. So if you get depressed and don't want to do anything, like chores or whatever, accomplishing them will actually feel good. When in dire straits to feel better, actually *help someone else*. Kind acts out of the blue, or working for an important cause. By focusing on someone else's well being and happiness we don't feel our own distress, but we do feel empowered. Meditation is a healing balm for the mind. Look up mindfulness meditation techniques. Meditation will help you focus your mind on the thoughts you want, not the bad ones. Like a muscle, you get better at it over time with practice. If you get all of these under control, your brain will be the most healthy it can be, and you can more easily tackle life's challenges to make your life REALLY great. Any other mental issues beyond that are what medication and therapy are for. I hope you can start a life for yourself out on your own! Hang in there and don't give up, if you dont' give up success is inevitable eventually!!!",2017,mentalhealth,1,0
"This takes time!! Barely a year and you are not better yet is no surprise. Mental health improvements are rarely fast. You are not wrong or bad or messed up because you are not better yet, you are completely normal. See if you can get in to an endocrinologist to check for hyperthyroidism. One of the side effects I get from it is excessive rumination - nonstop thinking about people who made me mad. Weird huh?! But it turned off the minute I got on some meds. Other symptoms- irritability, anxiety, head sweating, hair thining. I also hope you can find a therapist who can help you work through your traumas. Medication is good but it needs to be taken with therapy so you can learn new ways of thinking that aren't harmful. I encourage you to try out meditation, as that is the skill of learning to control your focus of your thoughts. Any meditative practice will help you stop thinking about the bad thoughts if you don't want to. Look up mindfulness meditation (Buddhist teachings in general are great methods for finding relief in new ways of thinking). Please be kind to yourself and know if things aren't working right with therapy or meds or any care you're getting you can ask to try something else and they must respect you. You will have to be the one to advocate for your own care and make yourself better, even if you weren't the one to make you sick.

"So, I'm still not good at this, but my best advice is to see anyone as a person first, and attractive second. Everyone, even beautiful people, have flaws, and they're own inner monologue, and self doubts, and pretty much anything else that hits at your confidence. They also do most the same things we all do, which means they've had bad days and embarrassing moments too. And, most of them have normal hobbies and interests that we mere mortals also enjoy. Humanizing them should make it easier to connect with them. They're just people, even if they're also living Greek statues. Again, this is something I still struggle with, but I think most of the anxiety people get from being around attractive people is caused by putting them on some pedastal. We're all just people, and we all deal with same shit.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0
"If you feel like really doing it, or need a caring soul – call a hotline. Don't even question it, just call. If you can't call, get out among people even if it means wandering the aisles at the only Walmart open all night or sitting in a booth at the Awful Waffle at 2 a.m. This sounds like suicidal ideation, rather than feeling actively suicidal. I went through many, many years of this feeling. I didn't want to kill myself, but suicide, death, and dying were very frequent, prominent thoughts. I'd also wondered what it would be like to do random hurtful things, like put my hand under a running lawn mower or drive into a median. (Do not do these things.) Sometimes I'd indulge the thoughts, other times I'd be scared that I felt this way and just knew I was crazy, feared I really could do something terrible on impulse one day - lots of anxiety and what ifs. After getting trauma therapy and medication that worked properly for depression and anxiety, I realized I wasn't crazy, just not well and needed the right help, and had my own work to do. If you're able, please start seeing a counselor and be totally honest and open about everything. If cost is a deterrent, ask about counselors who do pro bono or sliding scale work. If that doesn't pan out, start sitting in at support groups for depression, anxiety, grief, OCD, trauma - anything that seems like a reasonable place to start. (I strongly recommend this anyway) Tons of churches offer support groups if you can't find one that's close and not spiritual. Don't be put off by the religious aspect right off the bat if you're not into religion, because a lot that I've attended aren't pushy and (as with everything) you can take what works and leave the rest. If there's been substance trouble or abuse in your life or a close relationship, other good support resources to look at are Alanon and AA. I'm throwing a lot out here, but I'm thinking of addressing the reasons why you feel suicidal and off. That's the root cause you'll have to untangle and heal when you're ready. That's how it worked for me :).",2017,mentalhealth,1,0

My advice to you is this:try focusing on improving yourself and better times will come.Also,i would recommend you ASMR(search on youtube),might help you with the sleeping problem.YT is full of useful videos to keep the bad thoughts away,hell,watch a funny video that will make you smile,it does help,i have done it myself!When you get to bed,remember the good things that you did,leave the regrets out,because there's no point really! :) Take care man!",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

"I say you should go and talk to a professional to determine what the best treatment is for you as there seems to be quite a few a characteristics of different conditions like ocd anxiety and depression which suggests your diagnosis may not be completely straight forward, so it would be best to try and clear that up and avoid self diagnosis in my opinion. Although I'm not one to talk as I've never been in therapy! Although I do have many of the symptoms of those 3 conditions you mentioned. I have extreme anxiety and ocd I am certain. But I am seeking a psychologist now to sort it out as it isn't always black and white especially with something like anxiety which affects the way you perceive things so much, it's hard to be objective when you're under its effects, and the mix of symptoms just complicates things further. Just out of interest have you been self-medicating? I'm in a similar position to you where I'm starting to consider medication as it's getting really bad, but have always been a bit scared of anxiety medication! like Xanax if I was prescribed it i'd be scared to take it :\ hope I helped a bit anyway but I'm not too informed sorry!",2017,mentalhealth,1,0

Helping others can make you feel good about yourself and rediscover the vitality for life you might lack.

But sorting out her career so she's got something to be optimistic about and look forward to will take a big burden off her shoulders! I feel like perhaps she may be someone who places a lot of expectations on herself and when life has been tough to her, it has discouraged her and knocked her self-esteem somewhat. Would you say that sounds right at all? I just say this as a masters in biology sounds very demanding and to get to the end of that and find disappointment can be shattering. But the disappointment is a direct result of expecting a great job at the end of it.

"Paranoia is different to social anxiety for me. let me try to explain. Paranoia makes me feel like constantly looking over my shoulder, like there is a lingering thought that something/someone is behind me and I cannot rest until I turn around to confirm my suspicions (some OCD tendencies present in this) there doesn't have to be any physical reason for me turn around, just a thought that manifests itself uncontrollably, also warps my mind by turning completely innocent spoken words by others into some kind of attack upon me or that they are out to get me or cause me upset or annoyance... with anxiety, I am not afraid to turn around, I am afraid I will turn around and other people will judge me negatively for it (hence while solitary I find no such judgement and anxiety is greatly diminished), so much so I have convinced myself of this that when I go out I automatically feel judged before anyone has even cast a glimpse in my direction. paranoia is easily defined in my mind, where social anxiety is multifaceted, it doesn't just come from one cause it comes from a plethora (negative thought patterns, self consciousness, low self esteem, negative reinforcement, ect.) which all feed into each other. OCD, anxiety, paranoia, depression, to me seems like they are all interconnected in some way (having experienced them) and gain momentum from one another, a part of the invisible tribulations of the human condition.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

Having worked with a lot of depressed and anxious people, I'd say that what I just described is what happened about 95% of the time. If one can use something like the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) or some other ""instant clarifier"" to be able to [see themselves as they are and *why*](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/04/critical-thinking-and-logical-fallacies.html) (such conditioning as described above?), they are usually able to move up from the first or second of the [five stages of therapeutic recovery](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html) into the third and even the fourth. And once they get there, it's just a matter of... 1) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do the next six things on this list: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the clinician locator on the *Psychology Today* website.

Strongly recommended because they all understand the upshots of having been [stressed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=fight%20flight%20freeze) for too long, including [complex PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=complex+post-traumatic+stress+disorder) which is pretty likely what you have: Albert Ellis, Wayne Dyer, Stanley Block, Edmund Bourne, Matthew McKay, Aaron Beck, Donald Meichenbaum. *Accurate* information is power. 4) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any ""time bombs"" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=schema+therapy), and [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), as well as [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html). DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look [here](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), and [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), and [here](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and (for DBT specialists in particular) [here](http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm). If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. 5) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)-style? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now.) 6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=DBT+therapy+workbooks). 7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.",2017,mentalhealth,1,0

"You don't need her parent's permission to get help. Sometimes you have to subvert the parents to get help. The reasons why they don't want to support her through this is their own baggage that has literally NOTHING to do with her, so don't try and make her win their approval to validate her health. That will take too long and they clearly have some shit to sort out with their own mental health if their daughter is being medicated but they can't come to terms with the fact that she is suffering in a very real way. They are going to have to take care of themselves. Focus on your gf and get her help NOW. If she is school age then she can talk to a counsellor at school or uni. These people are trained to help people like your gf, so let them help. Even better, they maybe able to involve her parents, and when they hear this coming from a professional, they might be able to adjust their mindset. Coming from you and your gf, it might be easier to dismiss.

I end up being silent while the bf is having a blast and I keep pretending to laugh and smile, I even pretend not to be bothered by their ""manly"" dirty jokes that sometimes are borderline offensive to women.

"I've been in the same shoes as your girlfriend.

My aunt attempted suicide twice. Both times my parents made it out to be desperate attempts for attention and to this day, deny that her depression is anything but laziness and faked attempts for attention. In Asian American society, mental illness still holds a lot of stigma and it's going to be hard to bypass that. The only way that your girlfriend can try to get her parents to listen is if she somehow breaks down that stigma, to show them that depression and anxiety are real yet are not a sign of weakness, that proper support and treatment will allow her to thrive. She needs to sit with her parents, get them to listen to her and hear her struggles as they are, and maybe set up a conference with her therapist/psychiatrist so that they see that a fellow medical professional accepts the diagnosis or can at least provide evidence of mental illness. Some therapists are even willing to call parents directly.",2017,mentalhealth,1,0

"First, congrats on this big move! I wish you all the best - deciding to pursue such care certainly isn't easy, but can be very rewarding. I used to assist patients with finding doctors so I know it can be daunting. Your regular GP should know how to assist. If they don't have a specific doctor or therapist in mind, hopefully they can guide you from there. Your insurance company may also have resources online in regards to providers within your network. Speaking of insurance, in my experience, finding a psychiatrist or therapist that's ""in-network"" can be tricky. Before seeing any doctor, I always give my insurance company and the doctor's office a ring just to make 100% sure they accept my insurance as ""in-network"". Your insurance company should also be able to provide information about your plan (which you mentioned could be a PPO) and exactly what costs and services it covers.

"Well first think you really need to concentrate on your addiction, I've seen what that can do to people, but I think you know that so no need to hammer that. As for your mom I would say go one of two routes or both, first being have her sit in with your therapist or whoever you're seeing and have him explain things to her. Option two wait it out. One of the most frustraiting things with mental illness is that time sometimes does alot of healling but its hard to see it happen. And as for your mom it might take a while for her to get older and mature to realize just how much her behavour effected you and your sister. At the same time you might want to move out when you can, if you're going to college thats good but if not than you should try and maybe find some sort of community living or a roomate whos a good influence because you dont need to let your addiction control you. One thing thats important to know is that envermental factors such as your mother have a strong effect on how bad your symtoms become, like a dimmer swich the more you turn it the brighter the light same thing applies to stress factors. But as for ""getting over it"" and shit like that dont listen you can help urself but thats only when others can help give you power, and sometimes meds. You have a limited control of this and you cant force yourself to stop feeling depressed no matter who you are. Also if you every find that you're mom or anyone you're talking to about this is giving you advice using their experiance stop them and just try and tell them you just need.someone to listen to you cause doing that can actually hurt just as much as them not being there. Lastly (sorry for the long rant) but try and change your thinking, such as if you're ever harsh on yourself start talking to yourself like you would someone else. Would you tell them all the hurtful things you tell yourself? Its also ok to help yourself and be there for you, idk if that makes sense but I visualize me consoling my younger self and just being there, and tell myself its ok to grieve over whatever is hurting me and just trying to help me. Little things like that can make a big difference, but most importantly many people suffer from mental illness so you are not alone, and whenever it gets bad try and keep fighting, it may be bad sometimes, but if you keep going and seeking help you will win, you just need to keep trying to help you and if you dont believe me I understand but you just gotta keep going and one day you'll wake up and things will be a bit clearer.

I'm mostly doi g programming on the main project to further that peoject, and I also work a lot with another department of peogrammers specialized in datamining on the user's interacrions with our project. I implement stuff that sends data to their databases. I also do bugfixing like every other programmer in my department. My point is, I was scared shitless to do interviews, and when I entered the company for my first 2 weeks. I had no prior programming job experience, so this was pretty much like stepping on the unknown. And I adapted. It is scary at first, because you don't know anybody, you don't know what you're doing, you don't know if you're doing your job properly or if you are closing tasks fast enough. I know that for the first 2 months, I was scared that I wasn't doing a good enough job. My main contact throughout the first month was my internship supervisor, who was the lead for my team of programmers. I would report to him, I would get my tasks from him, and I would go to him for help. He introduced me to other people from various departments sometimes because they had the info I needed. He helped me fit in. He helped me know who to go to when I needed help from a specific department. After a month, I was pretty much ok with asking other people directly for help. I even started talking a lot more to the collegues that were sitting on the desks around me. After two months, I had and internship meeting with my school evaluator and my supervisor. And I learn that I was doing a great job, and that I adapted to and learned the project better than most interns they had in the past. However, he said that I was reluctant to go directly to other people for help and that I needed to broaden my circle of contacts. So overall, I wasn't doing so bad at all. I'm saying all this because I was in your shoes. Scared of interactions, scared of judgement from co-workers. And overall, I discovered that its not that bad. Its harder at first simply because you don't know anyone and you have to learn the project, and you feel like you don't know what your doing or that you're not doing it good enough. Truth is, you're an intern. You're not expected to know everything. You're not expected to adapt as fast as someone who has been in the industry for years. As for relationship, everything will come in time. If you're scared of talking to other people and need help with your tasks, go to your supervisor or your lead. Talk to him.

The adrenaline I needed to focus came from the way overblown social anxiety, not the more legitimate fear of bad grades Given that a lot of people with ADHD also suffer from social anxiety, it makes you wonder how much we could help by not treating them like dumb kids as so often is the case. If they know that you truly see them as smart and capable the consequences of letting you down may be enough to help them focus. Of course, this could backfire badly if you're expectations exceed their capabilities. I've been there too and it is crippling. Anyway sorry to go on a tangent. But yes, in general, I rely on that to keep me accountable but I imagine if I'd didnt have ADHD and were reasonably competent with executive functioning I may not appreciate it as much.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

"You know your backstory and you know what you feel, that's a great start. I would slice your backstory into a few keywords, add the word 'therapist', the name of your city, and drop the whole mess into your favorite search engine. Read up a few of the therapists' websites, and add/subtract keywords until it feels like the therapist knows what they're talking about. Then call and visit a few of them until you think you've found one that is 'good enough'. You can work through them and your GP to get most medications that might help. They can usually refer you to a psychiatrist should more complicated meds be necessary. I wouldn't go to a psych directly - I've been that route and they seem to just throw meds at you hoping one will stick without trying to understand where your mental state came from. My experience with PPO's is that they are pretty cheap when in comes to mental health. They have very few psychiatrists or psychologists on their list, and the ones that are there are extremely busy and seem to prefer quantity over quality. Very few therapists accept insurance, and PPO's in general allow payment only for a specific (generally short) time period.",2017,mentalhealth,1,0
"22 here, and fortunately I've at least experienced kissing twice and that was about it - no relationship though. I feel you OP. I used to get this bad feeling about how pathetic I am for still not experiencing something probably most people my age have and I'm just left in the dark, etc. You have two choices though: 1. You can keep on dwelling on how pathetic your life is, how you're a joke, and that things will never get any better which will actually result in that as you go further and further into the vicious circle of self-loathing all the time or, 2. You can accept that you have never been in a relationship yet even after reaching age 20 and just continue on living and trying to improve yourself. Remember, there are some people who have it way worse than us. I personally decided to go with #2 and break the vicious circle of beating myself up and started trying to improve myself. Started eating healthier, exercising, trying out new hairstyles, regularly watching YouTube videos on how to improve this and that. Also videos, pictures, quotes, etc, that boost the mood. There's still no relationship yet but we can't give up. Remember, there are some people who have it way worse than us. Apologies for the crappy english.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

"I want to start with saying, unless you're qualified you shouldn't be attaching diagnosis labels to your friend. I appreciate that you have good intentions but doing so can cause a lot more issues than it will ever resolve. I say this because depression can cause the symptoms that you're attributing to ADD/ADHD. I think the most important thing for your friend is for her to work on her communication skills. There is a type of therapy called mentalization based therapy which involves a person thinking about their actions and how those actions relate to their emotional state. You can read more about MBT here: http://psychcentral.com/lib/mentalization-based-therapy-mbt/ This is a treatment used for those with Borderline Personality Disorder, although I think that it can be helpful for a wide range of social issues. Perhaps it's not the right thing for your friend to necessarily attend an MBT group, but it could be helpful for her to read about the therapy and to try and apply it in her day to day life. Inevitably, if someone is 'acting out', it will distance them from others. The only thing you can do as a friend is to stick around and be there for her. You can't control the actions of others as much as anyone else. I don't think this is selfish but it is probably due to a lack of insight into your friend's position. It seems clear to me that she's unable to overcome her issues alone, the worst thing that can happen for her at this point is for her support network to break down. This will only compound her current issues. So, in summary, try to help your friend directly by trying to get her to think about her own emotional state and her triggers and maybe you can work together to figure out some small solutions. Indirectly, you can help her by educating those around her and making sure that her support network knows how valuable each and every one of them are to her, even if she doesn't realise it. To change the way a person sees themselves, the world around them and their behaviour takes a very long time and a lot of hard work, these problems won't fix themselves over night. However, with the right care and support you should be able to help.",2017,mentalhealth,1,0

If someone throws one dagger at you, you end up throwing 100 many more at yourself and beat yourself up way more than you should. It's not an attractive quality and you don't want to be a downer.

"I understand that you are nervous and it's okay to be nervous before a first date. I was in the same seat about 2 months ago so I feel your pain. For me personally my stomach hurt on the way to the date because I was so nervous, but once I met her and we started talking it wasn't that bad. The build up is the worst part, the actual date is not that bad. If it makes you feel better he is probably at home right now thinking the same things as you for example ""should I offer to pay?"". Also remember that he *wants* to meet you, take that as a positive thing and let it make you excited. As far as paying and what not it's pretty easy in your situation since I'm assuming that he asked you out and that you are a girl. If he offers to pay and you want him to pay then let him pay. If he doesn't offer to pay, pay for your own stuff. If he goes in for the kiss then do what you feel is right. If you want to kiss then do it, if you don't tell him you aren't ready.

They gave me weird looks and my crush re-blurted my statement, ""you've never had a girlfriend?!"" I was just being honest and in situations like this it really makes me proud of my best quality, and maybe a month or two later we went out! Not really a date so much but we both had fun. Of course I would maybe wait or never bring it up if you don't have/want to, but you were sort of pinned into an answer.

I generally don't care because I'm trying to be a better person, a better artist, a better me and to actually have self esteem cause I don't want a boyfriend if I'm just gonna be self conscious and a downer all the time. That being said I do feel awkward when I'm with friends and they're all in relationships or have experience and they're talking about it and I can't really say anything. Worst is when they want to include me and ask me why I'm waiting or they give me tips and such. That can get bothersome. But everyone has their pace, I know people who are 25+ and virgins.

"By the time senior year rolled around in highschool all my friends since middle school had pretty much abandonded me, i had zero people to hang with, my SA was so severe I avoided people at all costs. During lunchtime when everyone else was having lunch with their friends, including the friends i once had, i roamed the corridors with no one to talk to. I was so ashamed to be seen by anyone like this that i hid in the bathroom stalls until lunch was over. I didn't even want to be seen in the library. I felt alone, forgotten ,desperate for any sort of interaction, yet too petrified to even reach out just to say hi to anyone out of fear of rejection and reliving the ridicule i faced in the past. This happened for pretty much my entire senior year, alone in that stall. I couldve left at any time but the mind has a way of creating it's own prison out of past traumas we don't understand. I mean i still dont have friends but christ if i wasn't so afraid i mightve found a club to do some kind of activity with that year. How does this relate to what you went through?

"Medicine will not magically fix you, in fact it usually takes months to see a full effect.

People will get different medication depending on what they need, so I can't just give you a list of side effects. I take fluoxetine, an anti-depressant, for OCD for example.

"So here's the thing about saying bye. Yes you say it to your friend while leaving from a place but there are times when it's okay not to say bye. For ex if you're at a distance from him then * you just glance towards him and around that time if he looks in your direction then you say bye. * If he doesn't glance at you then you pause for a moment or two. * And by that time if he still doesn't then you just walk off. The only exception to this is when: * both of you guys were having some close talk few mins back. Then you can walk up to him and say bye2. * Or one of you was talking about something very personal. Whether that discussion got over or not the fact that he or you revealed something personal indicates a closeness. Then you can say bye2. Bye2: you're saying bye to him. It's expected in this case. Unless crowd circumstances prevent you from saying bye you can do either of the following: * walk up to him, call his name, say bye or ""cyu tom"" (easiest to do). If he's busy you can tap his shoulder. No one will mind that. * from where you are you could call his name and say bye. (Awkward if he's busy or distracted or you feel your voice isn't loud enough) * else just say bye normally (mentioned in the beginning). All of these are normal behaviors. Yes there will be corner cases, some rare scenarios where this rule might not apply but in general this is your guide for the next time. Do try it out and see how it goes.

"Fear of failure is so incredibly common with this sort of thing. We're all scared of messing things up, so it'd be better if we didn't try at all. That's what we think, right? I know there's a lot of things I've never bothered attempting because I was so scared of the possibility of failing, and I never even gave myself a chance to succeed. Ultimately, we all have to decide what's scarier. Failing, or never even trying. And yeah, sometimes even if you put yourself out there and do your best, things could still go wrong. That's okay. It's not just our successes that make us who we are, but our failures too. Every time we fail or succeed at something, we grow as people, we become different, we learn things. Sometimes failing can make you a better person, because you've learned from the experience and can do better next time. And I can relate to feeling boring and thinking that someone else out here is better, feeling like I'm just not worth the effort. But you never know what someone else might find interesting about you. Some of my own stories that I considered boring and plain have been well received by others.

"I'm the same.. I often feel ignored in groups even when i'm being nice and relaxed.. I actually find some people become very cliquey and switch to their social ego in groups, so i often find them very uncomfortable situations. Where as the big ego often gets off on it, depending on how the group functions or the real dynamics behind the group and the peoples relationships to each other.. however when i worked in an IT department, our group were super nice and we all tried to include one another.. so i think some groups often have a very narcissistic/hierarchal presence especially if the people in that group behave in such a way. I find many groups are not very inclusive and are just an ego circle jerk and are quite intimidating, because you can clearly sense the narcissism and fakeness going on around you.. so it depends on the group.. if you're only experiencing 1-2-3 groups in say one year, then it's a very limited angle compared to say the rest of the world.

"No and yes. Anger is the emotion of action, there is something you want/need but not able to get or something you have is being threatened. Maybe you don't know what it exactly is you want or what it is you're protecting or even how to actually achieve that what you want but the desperate need for action is still there. This is a problem in your body's mind and out of that insecurity it responds with anger as an urgent mechanism to get you to aggressively fix the problem(s) that's hurting you. So you could call it fear, fear of loss, fear of not getting something you need/deserve but fear is an emotion in of itself. Insecurity is more the right word of it, not the emotion of feeling insecure but the psychological tool to determine if something is threatened.

"I'm going to try and piece together your situation based on the very few context clues I have. I assume you're in a corporate or other team-based environment where your contributions are either adapted beyond your recognition of them or simply taken and added to the goal with no credit or context to you. It's incredibly frustrating to have the same question repeated ad nauseum (I.e. a boss or client simply not absorbing your answer to their question.) In my own cases like this, I've been lucky that I'm not directly in front of them, rather I'm on the phone with them. I'll deal with it by silently shouting (mouthing) an angry response or miming an aggressive action. I will then stick to my guns, and simply repeat the same answer to the same question. It may be helpful to you to realize that if the askers aren't absorbing your answer, they might simply be waiting to hear an answer that they want to hear. In those cases, if what you're telling is the truth, it is no fault of your own that they can't see past their own position to learn the facts. Maybe try repeating the same answer verbatim until they're the one who's angry. As far as handling it multiple times in a single day, see if you can get the second person that asks to advocate for you. Something like ""I've been asked that a couple times now. Could you tell your group about it, or if you hear someone talking about it, could you share my answer with them?"" Hopefully that will help cut down the number of times you are asked. As far as dealing with the actual anger from the situation, we need to break it down into its root cause. If I were in that situation, I know that I'd be getting frustrated by the fact that A. I've answered this before, therefore I've already done the work, and B. I'm having to do the exact same work again, which in my mind means that the first work I did was wasted. My only recourse in that situation would be to take a quick break (I've done twice the amount of work now, technically, so I'm a little entitled to it,) and during that break, I'd catalogue what I can and can't control. I can't apparently control how many people are going to make me waste my time, but I can control how much time I waste. I'd probably come down to writing a polite blurb and handing it out, or telling them to ask someone I already answered if I was really short-fused. I can't tell what your exact situation is, and I'm certainly no therapist, so please be sure to ask someone with more experience. Nonetheless, I hope you find this helpful.

"I walked away from FB a couple years ago and have never looked back. FB, for me, was a nice social security blanket, but it was also a great source of anxiety: fretting over who won't accept my requests; feeling pressure over incoming requests from old classmates, unsavory co-workers and random acquaintances; allowing myself to get sucked into drama and arguments and POV bubbles. Now I don't really miss that security, and I definitely don't miss the drama and other crap. I tend to keep communications with close friends and family one-to-one, which is more work but also far more gratifying. I also took a couple weeks off Twitter once, which was nice, but I'm not sure I'm ready to dump every last social network.

"So first off, you're English was just fine man :) Secondly, it sounds like you probably have a moderate level of SA. That's the good news though (as weird as that may sound). You can now identify your struggle and learn ways to combat it. Here are some major, major things I would recommend to you: - Look in to meditation and practice it every night - Begin an exercise routine and stick with it. The key is that you make sure to STICK with it. - If you can afford it, set up an appointment with a psychologist so you can begin talking about your struggles with someone who's gone to school for these types of issues. I can not stress enough of how important this one is. - Look into joining a local CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) group. Just do a search in Google and something should hopefully be in your area. - Check out the book ""How I Overcame Social Anxiety"" by Tobias Atkins. Not affiliated in any way, just a good read.

I strongly recommend you go and try it out see if you like it. I'm a very very socially anxious guy and whenever I'm in a place with a lot of strangers I'm always on edge and not fun to hang out with, but after I started ""going out"" I made friends with some ""cool kids"" and had some great experiences and brought me closer to a lot of people around me.

"I had a similar problem in the past. Everything seemed to set me off, but then my son gave me this book on anger. I'll see if I can find it and edit in the title later today. But the jest of the book was one central point... Anger is a choice. You choose your reaction to everything. There is that split second between some stimulus and your reaction where you decide. The choice of anger can become habit forming and like most habits hard to break. But you need to be considering the alternatives and sometimes (more likely most times from my experience) choosing a non-anger reaction. This doesn't mean you can never make the anger choice, but with most situations, it doesn't help anyway. A typical non-anger choice for conflicting situations might be to ask the other person why they would do or say such a thing. Sometimes it is just to walk away. This won't be easy, especially at first, but you will learn to catch that moment of choice and learn that alternatives are available. Now that I've learned how, I feel so much better, and can even chuckle when someone says something that would have triggered me in the past. Good luck.",2017,Anger,1,0

"Oh yeah, been to many karaoke nights. It was always a terrible time spending forever picking out what song I can sing from the lists, and dreading going up there. Then doing it and getting that thrill. And then having people come tell me how good it was, which is also not enjoyable to me. I was also a professional musician most of the times I went to karaoke. But singing was a bit of a stretch out of my comfort zone. After a while I figured out a few standbys I could always fall back on singing. Sometimes I enjoy the crowded bar scene though. I'm extroverted and enjoy being around groups of people and having conversations with Random people. Sometimes bar socializing can be easier on my social anxiety because I can feel superior or less likely to be judged negatively by the... type of people that go to bars. Also, they come and go and since they are all strangers that I'll never see again, it comforts me knowing that even if things go horribly it won't affect my future somehow. But after years of working in and hanging out at bars, I think the interactions there are actually much more likely to go badly. People get intoxicated and have their own inner demons and are more likely to lash out at strangers at a bar than most other social situations. What I'm saying is, after spending hours working in 1000+ bars, I've come to dislike how people are there. I'd rather meet new random people at pretty much any other venue besides a bar. Part of the problem is that I've never been a big drinker. The only times I've really had a blast at a bar are times I've gotten drunk. So my advice to have fun is drink. It helps social anxiety, feels fantastic, and that's what bars are meant for. Just don't make it a regular thing.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

"Definitely, I've been like this in varying degrees my whole life. Part of it could be a mom who was sort of critical--like she didnt praise me for my interests but was quick to point out negative things a lot. She could be a bit critical in her judgmental of people and, especially, pop culture and anything modern. Not trying to blame a parent, but sometimes having critical parents/parents who don't encourage independence can contribute in a way. More than that, I think human beings are sort of designed to feel a sense of embarrassment over perceived social faux pas. We are generally pro social creatures who want to get along. We like validation, and anything resembling rejection can hurt. I think it's important to remember that if someone disagrees or doesn't care about our interests, it doesn't take away from the validity or the fact that we enjoy them. It doesn't make it wrong in any sense, and everyone is entitled to their own interests. You do not owe anyone anything, including agreeing with them when you don't or hiding who you are in order to not cause discomfort. If someone shares their interests with you, I'm guessing you don't feel threatened or that what they said was wrong. One thing that worked for me was exploring the genesis of the conflict avoidant behaviors, keeping in mind I'm naturally a very sensitive person biologically. Rejection has always hurt me more than average. Maybe you are similar but it doesn't have to stop you from sharing who you really are! You have nothing to be ashamed over.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

I just recently realized that I view a lot of things out side of myself as being a reflection of me. For example, if music is playing (mine or other peoples') I'll feel like it's my responsibility. I'll feel the threat of shame or punishment by others if something weird happens. Especially sexual content. It's a really strange thing to think I'm at fault for all the random content out there. My mom unloaded her shame on to me. And I think this is how the cycle continues. If you're a parent, and something on TV triggers shame in you, you'll unload it onto the child.

"So I really struggled with this myself and these are my findings (based on the advice from the more socially gifted and also Dale Carnegie's 'How to win friends and influence people'): Basically the most important thing is to be interested in other people. Ask them what they did over the weekend. About their family (people will talk about their kids for DAYS). Future plans. Where they traveled. Their hobbies. Their favorite tv/show or book. It helps to be observant and save details for later (e.g. ""I head you talking about Game of Thrones the other day with Dave, have you seen the newest episode?"") HOWEVER, you also have to share a little about yourself. Don't be afraid to share a couple ""quirks"", it makes you more endearing (e.g. I'm normally reserved and quiet so people get a kick out of me animatedly talking about my 'The Bachelor' Fantasy league). Additionally, Have a couple interesting/funny stories to share about things that have happened to you recently locked and loaded to share in casual conversation. I could never improvise interesting things to share about myself in the past and this really helped me. Lastly, don't be afraid to ask people small favors. People like feeling helpful. Just make sure to thank them and look out for opportunities to reciprocate. This sounds like something an alien would do, but I initially kept a cheat sheet on my phone with conversation starters and personal stories to share until I got a little better at improvisation.

I wouldn't say I was friends (with really anyone), but I typically found a few people during each 9 week period that I could relate to.

I know that medication has made it easier for me to live my life and get closer to people without feeling as nervous. But that's always only part of the solution, with therapy or counseling being another large part. I'd also suggest looking for more clubs that you might join. Drama might not be for you, but some others might be more up your alley.

"It's really hard, and I like to use that ""It's more of an art than a science"" saying. My first was useless and I left after 12 sessions. Six months later I realized I was still miserable and saw someone I got a ton of progress from in three sessions and that slowly petered out over 18 months. Then I tried EMDR with one for just a couple months and it was okay. Five years later I realized I still needed to work on more issues, found another, and it's currently going well but I was really close to leaving a couple weeks ago. So on one hand you want to be happier/healthier and you are there to do that. If you aren't, you need to go somewhere else to get that. However, you haven't been in a situation like that anytime else in your life, I'm guessing. Where a person is actually interested in you, wants to interact truthfully, wants to share their true self and experience your true self. So I would caution you that you may be really shut down for a couple months until you can actually get real. It's surprising a couple of years in, when I think I'm being 100% honest and open, how often I realize how deep my defenses are and how much they are protecting me from things. Dr Drew talked recently about how he was two years into therapy before he really started talking about what he needed to talk about. Sorry if that doesn't help, but there's really no ""You know it's working if you remember it next session"" or ""You should expect one change every 2 weeks"". I'd bet that when you don't remember the last session, it means you aren't really present and healthy in those sessions.",2017,socialanxiety,1,0

"One theory: your mom. My family has a habit of being teasers too, it's pretty harmless and it should teach you that the teasing is small stuff and it shouldn't bother you. However if you are like me and go deep into your head, well it can be a problem. When ever I think about something bad I did or something I don't like, my brain focuses on it then turns the volume way up. I eventually asked if everyone could just lay off for awhile. That could be the first thing you try, telling your mother about the extent of the issue. Second learning to flip the switch in the other direction: It's good you recognize what, and I hate this word because of its constant usage, ""triggers"" you. Take it another step and try to fully identity, as much as you can, the things that set you off. I know it can be hard because once your brain begins its like a freight train going down a hill. I started by wearing out my body using up my energy and adrenaline, then I could actually think in peace. What worked the best for me was hiking, steep hills to wear out my whole body. It's gotta be something with intensive breathing and gets your heart going, but also more constant than work out machines at the gym. Gyms can be alot of stop and go, when I hike I go till I can't go anymore and then some, till I am literally bathed in sweat. On my way up I can but not always think about things that might make me angry, for warning this can wear you out faster. It's the hike back down wear I start mentally. I'm already tired but walking downhill feels good on my body, my breathing is labored but now my oxygen intake is steady, big easy breaths also feels good. This is where I start thinking about what could upset me, flipping that switch. However I'm too tired to react like I usually would, I might feel mad but I'm already exhausted and feel it kinda slip out of my hands so to speak. I tried to feel what my mind was doing and tried to recognize what flipping the switch in the opposite direction was even like. Think about something annoying, then breath it out, and I'm already breathing heavy from my earlier exertion.

"I beat the hell out of myself regularly. Think Ed Norton in fight club. Slapping face hard enough to leave hand print, punching legs to leave bruising, nails into scalp drawing blood. I've broken my hand punching my thighs, I've bruised facial bones, and had people think that I had a major fall from the green and purple bruises. I do it because I was raised by a father who destroyed things in anger. He'd break dishes, chairs, etc. My wife was raised by same type father so she tends to overreact to any signs of anger and at the same time reacts the same way when angry. I can't punch things or I'll be my father. I can't lose my temper or the problem grows. I can't be angry or I lose. So instead I leave the room, head someplace private and beat the fuck out of myself.

"Novel incoming! I have a therapist, I have had several therapists, and I just got my BA in Psychology and I'm going to grad school soon to be a therapist myself, so I have some thoughts on this. 1. Studies show, time and time again, that the most healing part of therapy isn't necessarily the therapy style (though some are better than others; I'll get to that) but rather the *therapeutic relationship*. I.e. the connection you have with your therapist. If you feel cared for, understood, validated, and secure, you will grow more than if you didn't feel these things and the therapist was using the ""best"" method of treatment. By this then, your relationship with your therapist is crucial. If you aren't connecting, you might want to bring this up with your therapist. And it's possible that, just like with making friends, you and your therapist are not a good ""mesh."" That doesn't mean one of you is failure, just that you might have better synergy with another therapist. A lot of people ""shop around"" when finding a therapist, and there is nothing wrong with that. 2. Some therapy methods have been empirically shown to be more effective with treating different disorders. Like, CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is shown to be very helpful with depressive and anxiety disorders, including SA. I'm admittedly a little biased towards CBT, but that's something you might consider looking into, and maybe find a therapist that practices it (therapists are usually eclectic and practice several methods, so many will use CBT to some extent). And on the plus side, you can do a lot of CBT exercises on your own! (Exs: [fear ladders] (http://youth.anxietybc.com/build-fear-ladder)). 3. The initial sessions of therapy are usually getting to know you and the therapist a little better, setting the foundation, figuring out what's going on with you. It takes time to build up trust to go into the gritty stuff, especially if you have SA and are afraid of being judged or rejected. It might just be that you haven't been in therapy long enough. 4. That's interesting that you don't remember what you talked about. Do you know why this is? I know for myself with previous therapists I would forget what we talked about because it was boring or didn't feel relevant, or it was too relevant and kind of overwhelmed me. Maybe knowing why you can't remember what happened will help make the sessions better. As a side note, a lot of therapists take notes on the session, either during (as does mine) or after. They are often (if not always, I can't remember) willing to show you the notes, so if you want to you can just ask about them, ask them what you talked about, etc. And to your actual questions, I would say you are acting a little too early. It takes time to unravel what you've learned and embedded in yourself for years and years. The exception would be if you really don't mesh with your therapist, in which case it's fine to get another one. And I have done better with therapy in the past, but not extremely so. But I had a lot of problems with my previous therapist that I don't have with my current one (she's awesome!) and it already feels different. I can already see some changes in my behavior (after ~6 sessions) but nothing too extreme yet tho. But I can tell it is going to be very helpful.

Why give up the one thing in the whole world you have control over - yourself - to others, let alone assholes pushing your buttons? Remaining calm by realizing you are in charge of your reactions is a massively empowering thing. You are in control of your self. I deal with the public as part of my job, and I get yelled at mocked, baited, all manner of shit thrown at me. I refuse to give in and show any reaction. Fuck them. It took a while to get to this, but the secret of it all lies with not giving a squirt of piss what other people try and get from you. This is how you develop a thick skin. Fuck them, forget them and go on about your day. Shit happens in life and shitty people happen too. Sometimes you gotta pop a Fuck-it-all and continue working through the shit; other times you gotta take the shitty situation, dump it into the fuck-it-bucket. Either way, do yourself a huge favour and stop giving a fuck about what other people want and focus on your path and use the energy to better yourself.

"One thing you might try that has helped me is the concept of ""The Maze"". It comes from a book called ""The Tools"" by Stutz &amp; Michels which I recommend. The concept of the maze is that sometimes stuff happens that pisses us off and we become trapped by it. Take your example of hitting the wrong deer. It pissed you off which is fine and normal. The problem is that one event ruined your whole day. You were trapped in ""the maze"" of thinking about this one fuck-up for the entire day and it fucked your whole day. The trick is to recognize this and stop dwelling on the past. I've been in situations where someone cut me off in traffic and it changed me from a good mood to a bad mood for the whole day. If you find yourself dwelling on something that is over and done with and it is ruining your present moment, you are trapped in the maze. Just realizing this is most of the battle. Why should I be yelling at my friend at lunch because some dick cut me off four hours ago? Stay in the present. Let that shit go. Break out of the maze. Good luck buddy.",2017,Anger,1,0
"Hey dude, what's good. I know how you feel, kind of: I also have recurring daydreams where I brutalize and murder my teachers and principle.

I always feel better after going on a rampage in GTA or after imagining my teachers being beaten to death. My case may be extreme but the fact remains: we are violent beings by nature, some more than others, but projecting our anger in a non-harmful way is a healthy thing. If you actually attempt to hurt somebody, even if jack-shit happens, I would recommend talking to someone. Doesn't have to be a shrink. Talk to friend, or go on a internet chatroom. If you actually hurt someone, go to a shrink. As a side note, if your interested in dreams and the like read Freud and Yung, they are the THING to read when it comes to dreams.

"When I was in school I felt like you did, except I actually did slack off and fail classes. I never planned on going to college so grades meant nothing to me. All I wanted to do was graduate so I would never have to go to school again. Because of that I thought the whole thing was a huge waste of my time and I felt compelled to do nothing whenever possible. Doing anything meant I was a part of their system and I despised the thought of that. I put in minimal effort and put everything off until the last minute or didn't do it at all if I could get away with it. There were people who would be disappointed when they got a B, but I would celebrate when I got a D because it meant I passed. I felt like school was hell and it would never end. Then one day I finally graduated with the minimum credits needed and I had to make up a lot of work at the end of the year. I had to sit in detention for weeks all day which was even worse than being in class. You probably don't care about my story, but I was just trying to say I hated school as much as you do. So then on to the point I want to make. I'm finally out of school, great right? Well now that I'm out of school I have to find a job and where do I end up? Working a shitty factory job with bad conditions that didn't pay that well. That job made going to school look like a cake walk. I was there for around a month before they finally fired me. After that I sat and did nothing everyday for over a year which got me nowhere. Now I've been at another shitty job and who knows if I'll get fired again. Maybe you know of something you want to do after you're done with school, but I never did and I ended up where I am now. School may not be that important to you, but you could be setting yourself up to feel the same way about your life.

But I've CERTAINLY got lingering rage issues from non-violent treatment as well. Very often, my current GF will have to stop me in the middle of an argument by saying, ""I'm not X"" to get me to cool off. Because you're so mad about letting the last one treat you in X manner, you jump to that conclusion -- or at least I do. Money is a big one with us, as I had an ex who would wreck her own financial shit and just expect me to come rescue her with my checkbook. (eg, taking her ex-husband to court over basically nothing, losing all of her money to the lawyer AND losing the case and then Poof! electricity gets shut off just in time for the kids to need to study for finals or research on the internet [also shut off]... getting mad just remembering) So now when money stuff comes up, my brain is too quick to get annoyed by it.

What happens when you just let people do whatever they want to you. You know better than to let any of this fucked up mess your parents ended up in happen to you.

"You need to apologize to him and yourself. Start with you. You made some bad decisions based on amped up testosterone. We've all been there. Moving shit sucks and sometimes tempers flare. Losing your cool and getting to the point of physically lashing out is something that you need to address in order to start living better. Head butting someone - friend or not - is an extremely aggressive act and needs to be addressed. Your frustration over moving things and not getting the answer you wanted (regarding your request for help) caused a serious amount of aggression and you assaulted another person. I'd begin by writing things down immediately. How you feel is important. Angry, frustrated, ashamed... it's okay. You're human. We do some dumb things from time to time (including head-butting friends). The thing is, writing out how you feel will allow you to start to understand more why things escalated to assault. You need to ask yourself a number of hard questions and you need to figure yourself out. Why did you get so upset? Who are you more angry at; him or yourself? If you can get a grip on yourself now, you can begin to make amends. Lashing out at others is not the way to solve any problem - real or perceived. Just remember that help is available and we all need support (men far more often than not feel shame and low for thinking they could use support, but it is this that keeps us from realizing our true potential). Edit: and just to make sure you understand: my brother and I used to fight a lot and I was a seriously shitty older brother. If I could do anything for anyone else now it would be to help them through these moments of trouble.

Breathing is always the best first step. It sounds ridiculous - I sure thought so when someone first told me - but just taking some deep breaths will increase oxygen flow to your brain and allow you to think clearer and you'll realize You have choices: you can react or just keep breathing and be with your frustrations and fury. It's ok to get angry.

You're recognizing your problem which is great. The easiest semi-fix is obviously to just cut alcohol out entirely. That will help reduce the opportunities to have these episodes. You should receive counseling if you've had sober episodes as well without just cause. Good luck!,2017,Anger,1,0
"I know when I resorted to similar tactics (punching myself, even cutting from time to time) it was because I felt like I didn't control anything in my life. But the pain was something I could control, so I resorted to that to feel in control. It's a surprisingly common reason to do so. In my case, just realizing that that was why I was hurting myself was enough. It isn't for everyone, and not everyone resorts to self harm for the same reason. As to anger: my mantra is that anger rarely exists in a vacuum. We're almost always angry *and* something else. Frustrated. Sleepy. Sad. Lonely. Hungry. Frightened. Disappointed. Whatever emotions we don't want to feel, we often mask with anger, especially when we have these sorts of outbursts that we know the situation doesn't call for. I know in my own case I focused on an ex and was certain that I was angry at her for mistreating me... becfore I realized that I just didn't want to feel disappointed in myself for honestly being a crummy boyfriend, and lonely because I missed her but had burned that bridge permanently with my actions. I'd encourage you to think very hard about whatever it is that's causing your anger, and see if you can't identify a root cause. Once you find it, you can begin to figure out how to make it better.",2017,Anger,1,0

"There's this book called *Radical Acceptance: Embracing Your Life With the Heart of a Buddha* by Tara Brach, Ph.D. It's helped me a lot. Some of what it talks about is mindfulness, taking a breath when any emotion is overwhelming you. Taking a moment allows you to pause before acting irrationally, and also opens up an opportunity for introspection. This may help you see things more clearly. Another thing I've learned over time is that resisting pain really ends up causing more. I always remember this one time when I stubbed my toe, I tried embracing the pain and it washed over me very quickly. The more I acknowledged the pain, the faster it went away. Brach also talks about the ""trance of unworthiness"" which is a term that resonated with me. Since you mentioned self-doubt, I'd highly recommend taking a look at this book. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions or if there's anything you're wondering about. And if there's anyone you feel you can reach out to, I'd recommend that as well.

"I'd never heard of the rules of retaliation and necessary defense. I want to look into that. About two years ago, when I really started to get my anger under control, I spend about 6 months in a kind of quiet hell. Internally, I was wailing, and once I actually uncontrollably did wail in a way I truly cannot describe, but even then I waited to be alone. During this time period, when I was angry, even a little tiny bit, I was not allowed to speak. That was the gist of my 'rules'. During that time, my blood pressure sky rocketed. Every time someone took my blood pressure for a doctor's appointment, they'd lose some color in their faces and give me grave lectures on how dangerous it was to ignore my blood pressure. I would try to explain it was work stress, and some of it was, but I knew what was really the problem. My blood was practically boiling in a literal sense. lol I don't want to assume I know what it is you're doing to manage your anger, but I think the sheer refusal to speak, at. all., when angry was the key. I spent so much time being silent when angry, that I had no choice but to shut it away, shut it out, push it aside and hear the other person or deal with the thing making me angry. I wrote a lot on my blog about the times my husband would be talking to me and expecting response and I so seriously, literally, could not speak. Not a word. Not a nod or a head shake. No communication at all was what he received. Eventually I started thinking about how it was a little unfair and that I felt bad for him being met with so much silence. And isn't that an eye opener? I was so angry at him so often that I was silent almost all the time. I'm looking back and trying to figure out when I started to feel the calm that you said you want. I wonder if eventually I simply gave up on being angry after having so very much pressure weighing me down and sealing my mouth shut tight. If the only way I could talk was when I was calm, then I had to let the anger go - I had no other choice. I don't know if any of this helps. I looked into a vow of silence during that time too. Something about it eventually seemed very freeing. Not sure if that's of interest to you, but there it is. Good luck.",2017,Anger,1,0
"Where did you learn this behavior? That is my first question. I don't know how it works for everyone, but for me, when I would attack (verbally) my husband or throw something, I was doing exactly what I was taught by watching my father abuse my mother (and myself). In therapy, I realized that every emotion I felt when I was attacking my husband was the very same emotions I experienced when my father attacked me (or my mother to a certain extent). So essentially, I was forcing a kind of rehashing or reliving of those traumatic experiences over and over and over again. As lame as it sounds, it wasn't until I realized that I was inflicting all that pain back on myself every time I flew into a rage, did I actually manage to see how hurtful it was. Again, it's lame, but as long as it was just ""oh my poor husband,"" I wasn't able to get a handle on the behavior, but when it was framed as me abusing myself FOR my father all over again, boy that motivated me to cut it out. I still have moments where I raise my voice, but they are not the norm now so they are easier to notice and I am often quick to see that happening and pull back out of the situation causing me to lose control. I've also gone off on random people that I NEVER would have lost it on in the past. While it's obvious that alcohol is a trigger for you, I'd also consider what's been going on in the week before your attacks. I've found that if I am experiencing something at work that makes me feel powerless, taken advantage of, or something like that, then I find myself losing control elsewhere when triggered by someone.",2017,Anger,1,0

"First and foremost, leave the knife at home. My god, trust me on this, you as a 15 year old are more than powerful enough to hurt someone without a knife.

He had some pretty severe bruises to his ribs and around his throat, as well as a pretty bad scratch from where my pen racked up the side of his face when I grabbed him by his neck. This isn't a challeng. Please, don't let yourself get to that point. The fact that you're aware of your anger tells me you're capable of learning from my mistakes. Can you talk to a guidance counselor? They're there to help. Would you be willing to do some work to [help yourself](https://www.amazon.ca/Anger-Control-Workbook-Matthew-McKay/dp/1572242205/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485482469&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=anger+control+workbook)? That book has helped me a lot. I liked how it read like the author was speaking to me as an equal, not speaking down to me. And while not everything resounded with me, much of it did. It's made me much more aware of what's causing the anger. You could also download the book for free [here](http://bookzz.org/book/2030322/82f906). It's really good that you recognize some of what's going on. You realize that you're taking the anger out on someone who doesn't deserve it. You realize that you're arguing with your mom when it isn't what you want. You've hinted at trying to avoid feeling that people think you're stupid. These are all excellent pieces of introspection. I wish I was that aware of myself when I was 15. How much sleep are you getting? If you're listening to music at night, I'm envisioning you not getting to sleep until the wee hours of the morning. Sleep can be a huge contributing factor to lowered control. How's your diet? If you're eating like shit that won't help either. Do you exercise? Even a little? A half hour walk at lunch or between classes can be very useful. I know there's a lot of BS in the media or from friends that says talking about it will help. Talking to a therapist can help, certainly. But talking to friends or just going over and over an incident in your mind can quickly more a mild interaction to a huge deal in your mind. Try to recognize when something is making your angry. Then try to remember that anger is something you feel as a result of something another feeling. We get angry when we think someone believes we're stupid, or when our own feelings of shame or inadequacy are triggered. Try to recognize those primary feeling. Then try to determine what the person said or did and try to separate that from how you interrupted their intentions. I you can do all of that, when a lot of the battle is understanding that there could be a multitude of different reasons for their actions, and most of them aren't what you originally assumed.",2017,Anger,1,0
"what u/totally_rocks said, but also: stay the away from substance abuse, getting drunk/high is fun and all but once you get used to it being there you are literally unable to function when access gets cut off. I smoked weed for ten years because it was the only thing that kept me chill, but whenever I couldn't find any or didn't have money I was constantly angry because I knew at the end of the day I didn't have that thing that I depended on to settle down. Dive into your music; you listen but do you write? Do you play any instruments, or know how to mix/dj? Take some time to learn, if you don't. Creativity is an excellent outlet for stress because it give you complete control over what's in front of you. It can be frustrating in it's own way but so long as you keep in mind that it's the process that helps, not pounding out masterpieces, you may find it to be a helpful way to chill out. And trust me, based on this post, I can tell you aren't an idiot. Maybe your standards are too high, or there are some very intelligent people surrounding you making you seem unintelligent by comparison, but I know actual idiots, and they wouldn't even consider that their problems are maybe their own and not the world's to deal with. The very fact that you acknowledge your ability to control your anger isn't cutting it shows a sense of awareness most people wish they had. Took me ten more years than you to realize I had a problem, and I'm not fukkin stupid so there's no way you're an idiot. Above all, though, just be careful. I know how gratifying it seems to imagine yourself just going apeshit on the world and getting all that anger out in one burst, but from experience I can tell you that that feeling won't last beyond the event itself, and it's immediately replaced with a similar level of guilt and self-loathing. It will only make your problem worse. And leave that kid alone, you know full well he's done nothing to you and you're just using him as a punching bag.

"Sorry you're having a rough time. I've had anger issues since what seems like forever. The one thing I discovered is that being angry is easy. It takes very little effort and it just feels good. But overtime, I discovered that it wasn't healthy, and even though it felt good in the moment, it made everything worse after things settled down. I would feel super isolated and depressed afterwards, and if I was angry at someone who I loved, I would go crawling back to them with my tail in between my legs, so to speak. It's a humbling experience, but one I would like to avoid at all costs. When I feel myself about to blow up, I take a step back and really just try to analyze the situation. I ask myself why I'm angry, what's making me angry, and how can I deal with it without blowing up. Now that's not to say that anger is 100% preventable. It's a human emotion and a valid one at that. However, one can be angry without blowing the fuck up. I can honestly say that my anger has been less frequent. But I've been where you are, where I feel like coping mechanisms just don't work, and that's ok. We all go through it from time to time.

You need to get rid of that energy first before you can objectively analyze your feelings and anger. Have you tried running?

If I don't I transfer my energy negatively to other people, and hurt them either emotionally or physically. After I wear out a little, I can get to my analyzing and self inventory. It does sound like you are under a ton of stress, is any of it removable? It's better to do less or be responsible for less if it means you will be taking better care of yourself emotionally and physically. Attractiveness really does come from the inside, just saying, you sound like you are beating yourself up, you need to give yourself a break. It's ok to be mad, but now you are saying hurtful things to yourself which may lead to growing your anger.

"Ok, first off, slow down. It's completely natural for people to feel uncertain about what they want to do. When I was in university, I know people that completely switched up their major, because they found out they didn't like it. The first thing to figure out is ""Can you afford to switch?"" Personally, I couldn't. I didn't like my major, but I have no money to switch, and it's not the worst major in the world. But if you have the money, you can afford to ""experiment"". Secondly, my university didn't care if you attended classes you didn't pay for, the drawback is that you would attend on your own time, and cannot be graded, which is completely fair. If your post-secondary institution has a similar rule, then you can try some classes as well. Lastly, talk to your counselors and ask what they would do in your shoes. They have some good advice regarding how to choose courses to maximize your time. But the most important is to ensure you have the money to switch around.

"Sorry to hear you’re in a tough spot at the moment. I remember going through similar years ago with my parents and I found it so frustrating at times. It sounds like your parents haven’t fully understood what the effects of your depression are - and they think that just by going out and being active it’ll magically disappear. Have you tried having a proper discussion with them about it? Not a heat of the moment one when things are getting stressed but just asking them to sit down and have a proper talk about how you feel, why you find what they’re asking difficult, and that whilst you want to be able to feel better that it’s a process that’s going to take some time. Have you also spoken with either a trusted teacher at your school - or even better a school nurse, pastoral staff, or guidance counsellor? Do you have any other close relatives (grandparents, aunts/uncles etc.) you feel may understand a bit better? Seek support from one of the above, and if the chat with your parents doesn’t work - or you’re worried it may not work out then you can speak with the person supporting you about smoothing things over with your parents and changing their understanding of your feelings. - your school guidance counsellor etc. Could call your parents potentially and arrange a mediated discussion with all of you. This may help support you, and help convince your parents as a professional opinion has also become involved. Hang in there and I hope you find something that works for you.",2018,depression,1,0

"It's sounds like you could have social anxiety. I have been diagnosed with it for a couple of years and identify a lot with the situations you described.

Also, being overly critical of your actions is a common symptom of social anxiety. Just the other day I was ruminating over an awkward conversation I had last week, and I knew it was an overreaction, but i just couldn't help it. Keeping this is mind, some moments are better than others. When you're placed in situations where you either need to or want to be social, then it's possible to overcome your anxiety. This is how many people with the disorder are able to eventually live without it affecting them, by constantly forcing themselves to interact with others until it becomes normal",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

"Breathe. Fear will blow things out of proportion and paralyze you. Fear is scary, but fear can be faced because it is paper thin. I know things are very difficult now - part of that is because you are living in fear now, the greatest fear, the fear of the unknown. The way to free yourself from this fear is to make it known. Whatever it is, it is better that it is known. Whatever it is, it can be dealt with. There are people on the other side of that door who have spent their entire lives learning how to help you. They are compassionate and understanding. They have a spent a large amount of time and money learning the skills needed to help you and they and they have done so because they truly want to help. When you cross that threshold - and you will - you will move from fear of the unknown to understanding why you feel so badly. You will get help and medicine to alleviate your suffering. You will be free of anxiety caused by this indecision. Everyone in the office wants to help you. Everyone knows that going to a doctor, especially for a severe problem, is stressful and scary for even the most confident of people. They will understand your worry, your uncertainty and your anxiety. You are not the first to come to them with an issue like this - they have experience. Breathe and trust their compassion and skill. Know you are asking this question from a place of self-love and a desire to be better. You are seeking freedom from fear and a path to health. Self-love is your friend, the part of you that is compassionate towards your own being. Right now, that is also twisted with fear so it may not seem like self-love, but it is. This same self-love will help you get through the door. There is no point in suffering through this fear and this fear is only as wide and deep as the door to a doctor's office and as soon as you pass through that opening the fear and anxiety will begin to relax as you make the unknown known. You got this. Posting this question was the first step - good job, asking for help is never easy. If you can do it here, you can do it there. You've already proven you can ask :) I love you. I know this is never easy, but you know it's not worth the fear. Breathe. Follow your sense of self-compassion and self-love, it will take you to where you need to go. Breathe. You got this.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

"Man, this hits pretty close to home. I lost a close friendship this year too, largely as a result of my own anxieties. Before I killed it, she managed to finally convince me to treat these problems seriously and go see a counselor, which I hadn't done before. That, in addition to a smattering of self-care in late summer and early autumn, was a good step. But my latest counseling sessions and long-stymied feelings for another friend - renewed thanks to our conversations regarding the lost-friendship-kerfuffle in August, as well as a couple visits I made to her place one state over back in September and October - have reminded me just how goddamn lonely I am. I guess I managed to bottle that up for a good long while, while I focused on my education; but the renewed impulse to focus on my mental health and becoming increasing dispirited with grad school hasn't allowed me to get away with that anymore. So it seems like we're in something of the same boat, I guess. Hyperawareness of our mental health leading to loneliness and malaise.. But at least we've still got some things. It's nice to hear you still have an interest in cooking, diet, and exercise - I know that eating well and staying fit does a lot for a person's confidence and mental wellbeing. And I'll still have my friend one state over. Yeah, she's probably going to be in a relationship by the time I resolved to be more up-front about my feelings when I visit in a couple weeks; yeah, that crushed me more than a bit when it slowly dawned on me last night; but I have to keep reminding myself that there's still no reason to catastrophize, or beat myself up for not being good enough, or not move along and take further steps toward living the life I'd like for myself. There will be further opportunities, and life's still very much worth living. Anyway. Happy new year to you too, friend.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

My advice is to simply continue to be aware of when these fears arise or are triggered during your day, and use that moment to focus as much as possible on your breathing and the present moment until they subside.

"From what I've been told by a doctor, social anxiety is a symptom of depression. To help alleviate depression he recommended cardio (jogging a few miles, or using an elliptical, etc.). While he told me to do it daily you'll probably burn yourself out doing that, so I'd start off doing it like 4-5 days a week. When you start feeling better about yourself (you'll know when it happens, you feel light as a feather and existence seems like bliss compared to the saggy shitty feeling you normally have), you can tone down the exercise to a few times a week. The point is consistency. Cardio exercise is the best advice I can give as it doesn't require you to talk to anyone, so no real potential for embarrassment. And limit how much caffeine you drink, that stuff can make you nervous. Plus eat healthier. Limit comfort foods like junk food and stick with more fruits and vegetables. And speaking from experience, don't look at your age and think you've missed a developmental milestone and are a failure as a human being.

"Quite normal for social anxiety. We're afraid of failure, letting people down or any negative feedback. So we tend to like being perfectionists, never failing.

"Sex typically and should be an expression of love between two consenting adults, and the fact that your parents connect to each other intimately is a good thing. That being said, your (sudden?) awareness of their healthy sex life clearly had a traumatic impact on you. Most children are understandably grossed out by or otherwise avoid thinking about their parents’ sex lives, but your reaction, particularly the fact that you are entertaining the idea of self harm to cope, is concerning and not at all typical. Because you are struggling to cope, I suggest seeking out your school counselor to start with. If talking this out with him/her doesn’t help, he/she may be able to help hook you up with an outside psychologist or therapist to further process your feelings and help you figure out why the idea of your parents connecting sexually is so traumatic for you.

I would definitely suggest seeking out medical help if it’s having such a huge impact on your life! Especially seeing as how you mentioned self harm - not something to mess with. I know money seems to be an issue, I’m from Canada so I’m not sure how everything works there.. but is there some counselling through your school or community?

What are the thoughts that are going through your head when you get those panic attacks? Next time you get one, write down your thoughts, so you can take a look at them later on. Chances are they will seem unreasonable after the fact. My guess is that similarly to depression, anxiety and over-thinking there is a thought pattern that you've learnt to follow that leads to a panic attack. You need to break that pattern. Writing down your thoughts during an episode will both help you learn to recognize it and (hopefully) will help you realise that those thoughts were unreasonable, making you doubt how true/correct your thoughts are in general (that's a good thing).

Try and think about it. Turn you screen off for 36 seconds and try and give it a shot, dear. It revolves around the ego. Meaning, any ""problem"" that is ""solved"" will never be solved, because the root is still there.

Getting into a ""dumb teen romance"" is really not what it's cracked up to be because you're just that, dumb teens who don't know what they're looking for yet; our first kiss as a couple (and my first kiss period) was actually rather disappointing because there was just no spark.

In researching on the internet you have to keep in mind that though other people's situations and such may seem more extreme, it does not make your situation less valid. Schedule a visit with your doctor and talk about your concerns. It could be as simple as needing to change your diet or you could have an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. If your doctor can't find something physically, then you can get in touch with a therapist to see if there is a mental health issue they can coach you through.

I think about stuff all the time and have opinions on subjects (I don't mean in a ""I'm right and they're wrong way, just generally"") but when I'm faced with people I just can't seem to engage in getting a conversation going, or keeping it going. I've tried the oft-suggested 'ask them about themselves' but I usually find it ends up being one sided and they rarely ask me anything in return, so I feel like I've got to know them a bit while they still know nothing about me, which leads me to think maybe they don't really want to. The exception is if I meet very easy-going people who are naturally talkative but friendly. I love it when you meet a friendly person who just brings you out of the dark zone immediately!

"All the time. I can recall so many cringe worthy situations in my 22 years of life where people would give me odd looks because they were in my presence. I’m quiet. I’m not sure how to start conversations and when I try I stutter or go blank mid sentence. Some people are more forgiving/understanding than others. Worst case is they think I’m stuck up. I went to a cousin’s bachelorette party and there were 8 of us women stuck together for 3 days. None of them liked me and I could feel it. I just couldn’t help but get caught up in my own world. I get anxious very easily, so participating in social settings and trying to be a part of the party is extremely hard for me. As I grow older, I keep analyzing my life and see why I’m the way that I am. I assumed I was awkward and shy because I was in my teenage years, but I haven’t changed much. Being an only child, my parents were extremely strict (still are) so I was very isolated my high school years where I believe that I should have been exposed to social interaction during that time. Instead, I was stuck at home unable to hang out with the few friends I had. I remember being miserable. Now I’m trying to change. I’m being kinder to myself about being “mute”, since in every social situation I end up feeling awful about not being able to hold that one conversation. My attitude has evolved a tad, thinking if they don’t accept me, well gee. Too bad. I feel like I have been socially rejected so much I had given up to even try to start a conversation. But even a “Hey how’s it going?” for me is such a win and improvement.

"One of the many problems that I've had to deal with whilst having social anxiety, is that I never know what to say as well, and just kinda took the advice of asking questions in a conversation to get them to do most of the talking. This can be a problem though if you aren't contributing to the convo as well. I find an easy way of getting a conversation flowing, is just talk about what you want to talk about, and then if the other person is interested in what you have to say then they'll join in. If not, you can always just keep talking until another topic comes in that they are interested it. Just keep trying and you'll have fun. Nevertheless good luck OP. :) EDIT: Also to add to this a thought came across my mind, even if the person your talking to isn't interested in the subject/topic your talking about, if you get good at conversational skills, you will be able to make a lot of things sound interesting to that person. :)",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

And to be honest, I couldn't either. Once we started talking about a common interests ( video games in this case) all the awkward just fell away and it was a lot of fun.

The dosage drops were too large and short and I would end up feeling like I had the flu. I realized that by breaking the capsules open and counting the pellets out and placing them in a new capsule, I could lower the dose myself in smaller amounts. I think I dropped it by 2.5mg every 2 weeks, but I don't recall the specifics. I barely had withdrawals with this method. I was able to stop completely and was off SSRIs for a couple of years. The usual method is to switch to Prozac which has a longer half life. I tried that in the past with another SSRI and it didn't work. I think I'm very sensitive to serotonin levels.

"I commend you for challenging your own outlook and seeking to expand your mindset through reading. While I might not have realized it at the time, looking back, these were important first steps for me personally that I took in order to help overcome my social anxiety. Two books that I found to be very helpful: “Mindset: The New Psychology of Success” by Carol S. Dweck Ph.D. Given the realizations you talk about, I believe that you’ll find this book to be helpful. Based on her extensive research, Dr. Dweck challenges readers’ various beliefs and outlooks on life, demonstrating how often times what we perceive and believe to be true becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The book broaches various subjects such as career success, relationships, sporting achievements and mental health. The premise being that our brains are a powerful tool either for success or failure. An engaging read and well-written, this book helped me learn to change many of the false notions that I’d come to believe were absolute truths due to SA. Additionally I was encouraged to adapt a growth mindset, learning from my SA struggles rather than dwelling on them, in order challenge myself to be the person in which SA had always prevented me from being. “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie On the surface, the title and the book’s contents have virtually nothing to do with SA as one of its main promises is to help people achieve success in the workplace. However, my social anxiety had taken me to a place where I little to no friends or even acquaintances and worst of all was virtually unable to start or even carry on any sort of conversation with most people. This book is a great how-to manual in the art of human interaction, told through engaging anecdotal stories. The best takeaway for me was the concept of active listening. Due to my severe SA, the idea of holding a conversation was entirely overwhelming because I was always afraid of being judged for what I had to say, and was oftentimes unable to think of things to say. What Carnegie writes and continually reinforces to his readers is that people love to talk about themselves, and by engaging people in conversations about themselves you make yourself instantly likeable. While this might not be profound knowledge, Carnegie explains this principle much better than I’d ever seen it put before, and implementing his ideas has helped me make many new friends since. His philosophy was great for me with my SA because I just had to focus on getting people to talk to me rather than hope they would be interested in what I had to say - especially since I didn’t want the attention of dominating any conversation anyways. Ironically now many of my friends are very loud, confident (perhaps slightly obnoxious) people that once intimidated me greatly. The reason being that I’m a great audience for them. What I found is that due to SA, I was already a very active, engaged listener to people and all I had to do was learn how to ask good questions rather than try to be funny or interesting. While books weren’t specifically written to take an in depth analysis, personally that was why I found them to be so helpful. When reading in-depth studies by experts and talking with mental health professionals, the unfortunate reality that I often encountered was that Social Anxiety was perhaps still poorly misunderstood by many of these well-intentioned experts. It’s a hard subject to understand too, especially for those who’ve never struggled with, because in part many people are affected by it very differently. The one thing that I have learned as I battled with my SA (and still continue to do so but to a much much lesser extent) is that ultimately only I was able to help myself. Initially combatting it was hard, but it only continually got easier and easier. Like I said, I believe your personal revelations are a great first step, as it took me a while to reach those same conclusions. Best of luck to you, I hope these reads help you as they did for me.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

Therapists can give you tools to use to help retrain your brain and way of thinking. It could also be a good idea to involve your girlfriend so she understands why you react to certain things in certain ways. She probably already knows about your previous relationship and why, but having a therapist or health professional explain to her why your brain is now wide this way might also be helpful and she could help you learn new techniques.

Maybe that's not the best for you, but for me it developed slowly until I realized I'd been doing it for a while and somehow months had passed. For me, it started with little nods to her when I did activities we had once shared, stupid little things like unloading the dishwasher and singing our silly thank-you song. Before I simply couldn't, and didn't, do dishes for months, but by taking on part of that routine (a part that would always make me smile/cry admittedly) I made it into it's own ritual honoring her spirit. It felt... better to actually complete the task, if only so I could sing to her briefly, wherever she was, and know that it would've made her smile. I guess I just keep doing the things we did together, because I feel like part of her somewhere would mourn my half-life, if she was there she would cry at how far I'd fallen and the ONLY thing she ever would've tried to do is prop me back up. I thought I would go first, with my illness, but that doesn't mean I have to hurry there. SHE'S got all the time in the world, and all I want to do is join her when the time is right and my body is done taking my shit and be able to tell her a good story of what I'd done.

I would only discuss something like this if they had brought it up and/or felt comfortable. I think having these opinions can be thoughtful and healthy but sharing them in the act of “calling someone out” is only going to further and worsen the relationship. Not that your wrong for thinking this way or would be for saying anything. say an addict whos using and or harming themselves or others I think at that point its important to talk to someone but remember to do it from a place of love and care because chances are thats why they feel the way they do in the first place is because of emotions running high and tense.,2018,mentalhealth,0,1

"Good on you for making an appointment. I had intense anxiety and depression for years and refused to take any medication for it because of bad side effects I had experienced in my early teens. Eventually my symptoms got too much and I gave in and asked for medication. When I spoke to my doctor about it I just mentioned the bad side effects I'd had on certain medications. They made sure to not give me anything too similar to them and they also monitored me closely until we found one that worked well.

"I'm in the same position as you. Was extremely shy growing up, but now I'm nowhere as anxious as I used to be. Now granite I still have my moments (talking to a cute girl and such) but over all I feel as if I've improved a lot. The thing that got me out of it was something that my brother told me once. That was, ""always talk about what you want and do the thins that you want. if someone judges you for that then fuck them. they don't deserve to be your friend."" After that I also tried going to stores by myself and that helped a lot. Especially when the cashiers start to get to know you, it makes you feel as if you're in some exclusive club once they start calling you by your first name. Also always smiling seems to work weirdly.

"I felt you did the right thing IMO. Its hard for me to believe she made a bunch of posts about her depression/anxiety just for the world to just sit back and see with a bag of popcorn. Putting your own struggles on blast on social media happens all the time, but if there’s an excessive amount of these posts or even just a few with serious undertone, it may warrant a check-in by anyone that has an ounce of concern. I get that she may be venting; keeping a journal or writing down how we’re feeling in a given moment is a great exercise to process and keep our emotional compromise in check, but if this reaches social media, she ought to know what kinda feedback she’ll be receiving. It makes me curious that she hates talking about it, yet she creates a bunch of struggle posts?

"Hi! I'm sorry to hear you feel so upset. Here are few things to keep in mind. You haven't seen your family in almost 15 years. It is going to take a while to reconnect. To build these relationships will take more than just this visit. If you want to keep building these relationships, you will need to stay engaged after your plane ride home. This could mean everything from birthday cards, to emails about things you know they'd like (eg, a recipe you found), texting them when something reminds you of them, etc. You've made the good first step of flying out and spending time with them. The next part is up to both you and them. A second thing to keep in mind are your expectations. It sounds like you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to make connections quickly and discuss common interests off the bat. As I said above, these things will take time.

"Hi! I had eye problems about a year ago and it is scary. I can empathize. I'm glad you are taking steps to go see your doctor. As you probably know with eye issues, it is important to get them looked as sooner than later. Don't worry about what your doctor will tell you. You have no way of knowing now and will probably just stress yourself out about something needlessly. So you feel more prepared for tomorrow, here is how eye visits usually go. Remember to bring sunglasses for when you leave (your eyes will be dilated). 1) Check in with your ID and insurance. 2) Sit down and wait for someone to call you. Use the bathroom if you need to. 3) An assistant will call you back and ask you questions about your eyes. The assistant will have you read an eye chart with both eyes, your left eye, and your right eye. The assistant will likely then put drops in your eyes to dilate them for further tests or for the doctor to look into. 4) It will take about 20 minutes for your eyes to dilate. It's a good idea to bring head phones for music or a podcast since you won't be able to read anything. After that the doctor will see you and talk about your concerns. She/he will either look at your eyes with that big view finder thing (sorry, don't know the medical term) or with a small, hand-held magnifying lens. 5) Additional tests or follow up may be required if they can't diagnose you same day.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0
"A counselor could definitely help. Are you in HS or college? If you are in college there should be good therapists and psychologists. Try to schedule an appointment with one that deals with anxiety or SA. If you are in HS, a counselor may not be as well trained for anxiety or SA. It kind of depends how big of a school you are at and if they hired the right people. If you are still under you parents insurance you can always see a non-school affiliated therapist or psych. You will need to talk to your parents about seeing one and call the insurance company to see which offices or therapists are covered under insurance. Your next step would be to call those offices and see who is accepting new patients. Then schedule that appointment. It's good to start looking now if you are considering it as it can often take a while to finish get a new patient appointment. I've been seeing a psych now since May and he has helped me so much.

Yeah it’s embarrassing but anyone who laughs is kind of being an idiot in my opinion. As you continue, you’ll see others making mistakes and it won’t be as big a deal.

"Ha meant to be amoebas!!! That made me laugh out loud, I’ve often referred to myself as an amoeba. The conflicting thoughts and feelings about all this make it all impossible most of the time. I think for me, my PE lessons at school damaged my self esteem to the point of self-hate (a story for many, I’m sure..being left till last when the popular kids picked teams, threw netballs at my head etc etc) and my parents and grandmother wrapping me so tightly in cotton wool that I developed a fear of injuring myself. Ironic, seeing as I recently injured my knee for seemingly no reason at all. It just ‘went’...maybe because the muscles need work!!! I saw a really shitty workout on TV a couple of years back with a Z list celeb who I didn’t think much of, and thought “well if they can do it, so can I”, so I tried alongside them. They did things like jumping jacks etc in groups - count down from 40, take a tiny break. Count down from 30, take a tiny break. Then 20, and then try really hard for the last 10. For some reason, it gave me hope of completing just a simple physical task like that and I felt a (albeit very small) sense of achievement when I reached the end. Counting seems to help me. Maybe because it’s because you KNOW there’s an end, it’s very soon..and it gives you more control. Whereas with workout videos that go on for 30+mins, I always find it overwhelming. Since your post, I’m now thinking of putting together a playlist of awesome, cheesy songs that are fun to dance to when alone, and perhaps that, over time, will lighten up this ‘moving’ thing and make it not seem like we’re about to die!

"I had a similar experience. I was terrified of speaking on the phone because I didn't really know how to talk to people. My Dad (who is a GP/Doctor) noticed this when I was in high school. He's the type of person to always put me in the deep end because it makes you face your fears. It's how he was taught. It's a good thing. He ended up making me work at his surgery helping the receptionist and answering calls during the holidays and sometimes weekends. The ladies working for him realised I had trouble with anxiety on the phone and told me that no one expects you to be very formal on the phone, no matter what working environment. If you make a mistake, it's fine, the person at the other end of the line won't mind if you talk slower than normal or have difficulties. You can tell them ...""sorry about this, I haven't been working here long and am still getting used to the controls"" if you make any mistake. People are understanding ;) Over time I gained some confidence, and many patients were elderly people and it's a good intermediate to building that confidence talking to people :) I had another test of this when I befriended a girl (I'm a guy) who would ALWAYS call me up and we'd end up talking for hours.

"The one thing I've learned in my own life is understand the huge difference in physical loneliness and mental loneliness - really it's all within oneself. This is only my opinion and I am not a professional, but: we feel alone because we cannot voice to anyone how we feel or what we're experiencing at any given moment - I've found this to be regardless of the physical presence. We want people to understand, and comprehend; to have gone through what we have, or maybe be able to echo the same level of emotions (whether happy, sad, or angry). It's going to sound cliche as hell but you need to learn to befriend yourself. It's going to start with disconnecting and really listening to yourself instead of avoiding it (by watching shows, consuming substances, ingesting alcoholic beverages). There are a ton of ways people avoid themselves as people, and the biggest way I've found to face it is to simply embrace myself even when I am disappointed with the negative emotions and thoughts I have. It's okay to be alone and with yourself. Support is awesome, but if you refuse to walk, what was the point of someone helping you up?

"Hey, I'm really sorry to hear that. I've been through a similar experience, and I know it's cliche to say this, but it does get better. On Dec. 31st of 2016 I started dating this girl named Ray. I loved her with everything in me, and would do anything just to keep her happy. She was my everything. Sadly though, a fell into a very dark place during the last month of our relationship. Things at home (btw, we weren't living together yet) were getting really bad. So bad in fact, that I almost ended it. I didn't know how to handle my feelings. I had no one to go to for help. I was getting ready to enlist for the military, and I was afraid I'd I did turn to someone for help and the military found out, they'd never let me in. So I was stuck. I didn't want to tell Ray what was going on at the time because I didn't want her to worry, and I could see that it was torturing her because she couldn't help. Since my sadness was also making her sad, I ended it between us. I also ended because I honestly didn't think I was going to be alive for much longer and I didn't want her to have to go through that. Fast forward 9 months later and it's Decmber of 2017. Everyday after we broke up, I thought about her. I still loved her, but the friends we shared says that she didn't feel the same way. Plus, I still felt guilty over the whole situation. I wanted to be with her again, but I knew it wouldn't be the same. I was like you. I wanted her back badly, and when I found out she liked someone else it killed me. I too asked myself when the thoughts would end; about when I would stop thinking about her every damn day. That December, I decided to write her a letter explaining everything. To my surprise, she wrote back. She positively told me that she understood everything, and at that moment I finally received closure. Now I'm okay to be honest. I don't think about her anymore unless I have to, and I don't talk about her with any of my friends anymore like I used to. What I think you need is closure, too. I couldn't tell you how to get it because it's honestly up to you how you get closure. I just hope you have the best of luck with it, and I hope I've helped on some way. And about the anger side of things, try some exercises to call yourself down. I too have some pretty bad angry fits at times. I run on a treadmill when I feel upset, and I've also picked up some new hobbies to keep my mind off of the anger when it hits (guitar and wood working are the hobbies). I've also read that yoga and meditation help pretty well also, so maybe you could give those a try. If those things don't help, see a doctor about it, or at least call a clinic/hotline and talk to someone about it. Good luck to you, and best wishes. :J",2018,Anger,1,0

"One way to look at it is as follows: When we are young, we know nothing about the world, we're just full of potential to learn. When we become older, our naive ways of trying to be curious, happy and safe are often challenged: it's not 'good' to want to hide behind mommy, it's not 'good' to yell really loudly when you're happy, it's not 'good' to want all of the candies at once, it's not 'good' to cry, it's not 'good' to be sassy to your parents or teachers. Most people will encounter negative situations and feedback, and if we're unlucky and have very judgmental or strict people around us, we often learn very quickly that a lot of the things we do are 'not good', and that things we don't like 'have to be done'. To some degree this is necessary for growing up: everyone has to compromise in little or big ways to get along in public, and learn important rules so everyone can get about their day smoothly and look after themselves well. Unfortunately, many of us, especially highly sensitive people who are good at reading between the lines, and NOT good at ignoring feedback (HSP's are known for very deeply processing pretty much everything that happens), end up learning lessons that are damaging. This critical inner voice we develop had a purpose, once: to help us fit in, to help us get the conditional love we were taught to expect, to avoid getting in trouble with abusive or just crude people. In order to hunker down like that, our mind got used to making us worry, to making us very, very afraid of often little things, of teaching us: these things you are afraid of are HYPER IMPORTANT AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE IF YOU FUCK THIS UP. Many people grow up with these kinds of lessons, and it takes effort, support and courage in order to challenge these lessons we've learned. To try and allow ourselves to mess up. To take a risk and just DO that silly thing anyway. To stand our ground and say 'no', or to be daring and say 'yes' to that thing we were told to never want. These worries are old hurts, things that were put into your mind, and you're free now to choose for yourself what kind of world you want to live in. It's difficult to un-learn these lessons we were taught as children, but it's worth it. If you have problems with hypervigilance, it may be useful to examine what sort of things trigger you into being stressed out especially and eliminating these (even if temporary) if you can, and to look into relaxation techniques to at least let your body come down from this chronic state of overwhelm so you stand a chance of thinking straight. I'd recommend looking into TRE of Dr David Berceli, they're simple exercises you can learn that seem to have pretty legitimate results in helping people with chronic stress due to acute or chronic trauma (and life can give you that just fine without a specific event) calm down and become more flexible again to change how they react to things. Without a physical state of 'safety' it'll be close to impossible to change things just by thinking hard, your rational mind cannot 'win' from a body state that screams 'we're going to perish, ahhhhh, fire everywhere!!'. Yoga and meditation are really valuable in that aspect as well, in that they can help you reach a better body-state before you try taming your mental state. I'd really recommend starting there. If you absolutely cannot make any headway, medication might be helpful to you to get things kickstarted, too. Medication has its disadvantages and it's not a 'cure', but if your quality of life is seriously problematic and they can help you past that big bump in the beginning of making changes, there's no reason why you wouldn't consider it.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

"When answering it helps to address the implicit insecurity people have when they ask this, you already wrote this is a part of the problem. Often they are not familiar with the notion that silence can be neutral, or they will outright think it means you don't like them or that you have problems. In the situation of 'being shy', in a sense you do kind of have 'a problem', it's just not a big deal in the end. It can be a great opportunity to combine admitting something about yourself (I'm a bit introverted and I like being very focused, I can also be kind of shy and not really know what to say, sometimes it takes me a bit longer to feel confident with new people and new situations, though...) with saying something nice about the other person (... but I feel pretty okay here in the office/in class and you seem like really nice people). This sort of approach helps create a little rapport between you and the one asking: it confirms you're not some sort of arrogant or weird douche, and it gives the space for a little bit of honesty. Very often, people will be quite understanding, and will be willing to even see how they can make things workable for you. When someone at the office tells me they're shy, my first instinct as an introvert myself is to tell them that's perfectly okay, and let me know if they'd like us to make sure they're invited to lunches or other opportunities to get to know each other too. I also valued being able to tell people I can be a tad rigid/by-myself, it gave me the time to take initiative on my own and join in with new things once I felt I could manage taking a leap of faith.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0
"Man, life isn't high school forever :) Having good familial bonds and spending time with your grandparents is cool, some people would be mad envious of you! It can maybe 'look' kind of uncool to people with the world concept of teenagers, but what do they know anyway : P Teenagers are stupidly self-conscious and that age kind of comes with its own cultural rules, but hanging out with your fam is *always* cool if you're not being bullied into it. Who even cares about 'unusual' anyway, whatever anyone might think isn't going to affect your life unless they're the kind of douchebags who'll come up right to your nose to say 'haha, I think you're pathetic'. And who wants to listen to a douchebag, anyway. I think one of the connotations of being seen with your elders is the implication that the teenager or adult in question might not be capable of going out by themselves or is 'settling' for their family because they don't have any friends. Screw that, though, that's making assumptions based on nothing, and even if it WAS the case that someone needed support getting around or didn't have any friends to go out with, that's their business and their life. Many parents and grandparents enjoy spending time with their family, even their older kids. I mean, you spend twenty years cleaning up after them and raising them - if you cared about them you'd enjoy getting to be a limited part of their adult life, too. It'd be kind of inconsiderate to deny yourself the fruits of being a grown-up family because of awkward-teenager-things.",2018,socialanxiety,1,0

"How old are you? From the way this is written and the context I'm going to guess 13-15, not that it makes your anger any less valid but your age might help put things into perspective. It sounds like you need professional help. There is no shame in asking for help and I think it could be the best thing you do for yourself, especially with your suicidal thoughts/tendencies. There is NOTHING worth taking your own life or harming others. If you are under 18 (assuming you are and that you're in the US) talk to your parents or school counselors, there are plenty of resources available to you to take control of your anger. If it's a video game ""triggering"" your anger then it might be better for you to put the video games down. Video games are supposed to be fun and it sounds like you aren't having fun. I play video games as well and I stopped playing some because I couldn't enjoy them due to my anger being triggered. Find a different game, mode, or play style. Do something to better yourself every day. Exercise, find a hobby, be social with peers/friends. On top of that meditate daily, even if it's 3-10 minutes a day, do it. As far as what to do when you are triggered, there are 100's of ways to come down from anger and it all depends on what works for you. I have found that expressing my frustration out loud is a huge help. Example, my wife does something that annoys me and I start to feel frustrated I will say something like, ""I'm frustrated at the way this happened."" or if I get tilted in a game I will say, ""Man that was frustrating.""",2018,Anger,1,0

"I would say you are much more in tune to things like embarrassment and shame than most people are. But having to pull things out of people just because it's right isn't always good for the other person. So try not to have to show that you are right all the time. Be more selective and conscious of when you choose to do it. It can open wounds for people who are not ready to address them. Or they never intended to share even though you (or others) can see right through them. A lot of people are walking boxes of stitches and bandaids. Try to give some padding to the people you love and want to keep close. Even though people are compelled to say they are ready for the ""real truth"" you have already discovered that they are not. They are not ready to be that explicit and forced to say it out loud. You have already discovered the boundaries most people are comfortable with. Humans are ultimately fragile creatures and we have to be careful with the ones we love. I would offer two things: Try not to hurt people for fun. They will resent it and as you get older you will become a pariah and have no idea why if you don't start paying attention now. If you realize you are hurting people you love and can't modify your approach please seek a therapist. They're not that expensive, especially if you have health insurance coverage. Since you said you have an artist side, use it to express yourself and show your vulnerable side. YOUR vulnerability, not everyone else's. None of this means you can't use it in a way that is meaningful to you. But when you can't help it and need to reveal something about human nature, keep it anonymous. Don't call specific individuals out. You should start writing if you haven't already. If you don't know what to write, start keeping a daily journal and really stick to it, every day!

"The fuse takes practice. Everything you are doing to be aware of your mood when specific things happen and the exact things that trigger you is time well spent. So be sure to cut yourself some slack and try not to get mad at yourself for getting mad, if you know what I mean. You're working on it, so if you get mad, replay what happened and ask yourself a few questions for the immediate thing that just happened and you got mad. These questions are for whatever just occurred and made you mad (not a historical or lifelong analysis - literally, what just happened in the last five, ten twenty minutes - really try to delineate specific events and emotions as they played out): * When exactly was it that I first started feeling strong emotions? * What were those feelings and was it something someone said? * What assumptions did I have that made the emotions start escalating? * Is there a story that pops in my head that makes me defensive or feeling like I'm being judged? What is that story and is it realistic? In anger management books, anger is often called a secondary emotion because it comes after another emotion is stimulated. As an example, when someone criticizes you at work you first might feel affronted, shame, guilt, defensive, all kinds of things come up depending on what is happening. Whether you are right or wrong, that can bring up a lot of different thoughts and if we don't learn a perspective for going through the thought process that results in constructive interaction, we can jump to getting really angry very quickly. Anger is associated with the fight or flight response (controlled by the amygdala). So when you get that initial anger response, fast pulse, ready to stand up and throw a lamp at somebody, that's the fight or flight response. The fuse, whether it's long or short is the distance between the initial emotions and the time it takes for your rational mind to come back so you can properly evaluate what is going on. So the sooner you can recognize something is triggering you and slow things down for yourself by separating yourself from the triggering event or person, going for a walk, saying I'll be back in 15 minutes and we can discuss, etc., the sooner you can deal with things in a more measured approach. Perspective is important. And a way to put things into perspective is to remind yourself: * I don't have to be right. * There are different ways of doing things. * Nobody can read my mind and I can't read theirs. * We have to talk things out to reach a mutually agreed approach. * Sometimes I won't get my way and that's ok. * My relationship with my coworkers is more important than this tiny issue. Improving your ability to take criticism without taking it personally and to negotiate solutions are huge skills that help and you can work on them at the same time. Books like Difficult Conversations can be helpful with that. If you want something to follow up on I always recommend [Anger Management for Dummies](https://hmt.es/Anger%20Management%20For%20Dummies.pdf) because it's a direct approach and it also shows how to find resources you need, depending on your situation. For you I would also recommend one of my favorite books [Take Charge of Your Life](http://carolsnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Take-Charge-of-Your-Life.pdf) by William Glasser. He's the creator of Choice Theory / Reality Therapy and for me this book explains it the best. It's a great complementary approach to CBT but honestly I feel a lot more empowering. I hope this helps you! Good luck! Edit: Sometimes you only need a 15 minute break to cool down. But if you are getting really worked up, you should take up to an hour. If you come back, talk more and get worked up again, take another hour. You can also wait until the next day if the situation allows. That way you can manage your reaction and response.",2018,Anger,1,0

"If you are already ready to leave, what happens on Facebook is secondary. Your mental and physical health is more important than social media. Mutual friends of the husband and wife usually take lines in a divorce and there's nothing you can really do about it anyway. Your real friends will stick by your side, so just unplug from social media for a few months if it gets ugly. People deal with this every day. You can even get restraining orders these days and sue someone for defamation of character, etc, etc, but don't even worry about that right now. Whether you stay or leave, because you've been through so much, please read [Getting Together and Staying Together](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Together-Staying-Solving-Marriage/dp/006095633X). It's a very practical husband-wife relationship book that deals with these kinds of issues. But you need help faster than you'll be able to read and absorb its advice. If you're going to stay together, get a copy and start working on it. When you're done she needs to read it too. But right now, I would seriously suggest you go to therapy together. Couple's therapy. If you have insurance it usually covers therapy costs and you'll only have a copay (between $20 and $50 per session). You can call your insurance provider to find out how many sessions you can have and what the copay is. You do not have to tell them why, just that you are seeking relationship counseling. If you don't have insurance it's a little expensive, usually in the $100 per session range. To find a therapist you can get a recommendation for someone from your regular doctor. It doesn't have to be a referral, just a name and phone number. If you don't have a regular family doctor insurance companies in your area often have websites where you can look up a provider (a therapist) to call and schedule an appointment. Most people don't realize men can be on the receiving end of an abusive relationship too. How our partner behaves affects us. Plain and simple. So you have to set boundaries, very explicitly. If she's going to get super mad, you are going to walk away until she calms down. And reassure her you will talk to her again, even of it's just in ten or fifteen minutes. But not while she's blowing up. Good luck! You gotta do what's right for you.",2018,Anger,1,0

"There are three things you can look for if you're wondering if you have an anger problem. 1. Do you get angry too often? 2. Do you stay angry too long? 3. Do you get angrier than a situation reasonably requires? If I had to guess, it sounds like you get angry too often during stressful times and your anger is unreasonable for situations. Your options include finding more info until you're sure about next steps, talk to a psychologist or other expert, take a class, read a book.... there are lots of resources out there. I think any option is a step in the right direction. The biggest mistake would be to know you need help and doing nothing. If therapy is too big of a leap right now for whatever reason, do something else.",2018,Anger,1,0
"I've taught anger classes for a decade. The why question is complicated. Here are a few key things that might give you some insight... (1) Anger is a secondary emotion. So if you're feeling anger there is another emotion that came before it and is responsible for the level of anger you feel. (2) Anger can feel like it's coming out of nowhere because so much of the anger process happens in our subconscious. Some research says we live our lives on auto-pilot up to 70% of the time on average. That's a lot of time for a lot to happen. (3) Mindfulness and awareness work could help you figure out what your triggers are and notice them before you're at the point of rage. You can get control. But controlling anger when it's intense is virtually futile. (4) Finally, the simplest reason behind anger is that we don't express the underlying issue. We often suppress it. We're so good at suppressing it, we can spiral into intense anger without even knowing there is something else to express. BUT if/when we express the underlying needs, anger can be an unnecessary step.",2018,Anger,1,0
"If you worry you are going to explode, don't ignore it. That kind of awareness is a gift. I know 100s of ppl who blew up and cops got involved.

There are tons of online resources, access to books via the library, I might be able to share a free online class with you. I'm new to reddit so, if I can find it, I'm not sure how to get it to you. Yoga and meditation can be helpful, but you need something more tailored. Not to mention, mindfulness (which I think is the best form of meditation for this issue) can exacerbate anger before it helps. It's kind of like how Physical Therapy can make pain worse before it starts getting better. You need support but you can do this. And lemme just say, it takes guts to be self aware and get help. Most ppl ignore it because that's easier. You're already on the right path, even if you don't feel like there's anything good here.",2018,Anger,1,0
"Personally speaking, I've found that drinking exacerbates the issue more than I realized. And it's a kind of catch 22. On the one hand drinking provides a sort of temporary relief, on the other hand that same relief comes with an additional price to be paid one way or the other. For me I asked my Dr to put me on something that would take the edge off of those feelings so that I could work them out. She put me on a generic for Prozac with a low dosage, and I think that is helping. In any case you are on the right track by reaching out for ideas that may help. If you have any insurance I would consider it worth the effort to talk to your Dr. If nothing else, they are going to have options based upon experience dealing with many persons with similar issues.

"meditation and yoga are misunderstood. About yoga: I learned some postures and it helps me release body tension. I once had a very crunchy practice but eventually shaved off the newage junk and habitualized key stretches with conscious breathing.

I managed to have a disciplined formal meditation practice for long enough to understand 'mindfulness'.

"I think it really depends how open you are in receiving the message it will be sending you. You basically go over everything that may lead up to and cause a angry outburst or even a violent behavior toward someone else. You go over triggers and how to slow down and think things through. Example is if someone says something or does something that sets you off, you should take a “time out” to think about why that is causing strong emotions and if your next action will be effective in stopping the action. Most of the time that answer is “no”, since you probably have had this argument many times before and it never got solved. I think the hardest part for me was learning a lot of basic things that I never naturally learned (not from parents, not from siblings, not from teachers etc ) so it made me feel like I was in a remedial class about how to have a normal temperament.

"Something I’ve been struggling with lately, too. I’ve been letting myself get angry, but then I force myself to process the situation. Letting the emotion out helps me gain perspective rather than sitting and stewing/ruminating. It’s allowed me to see the moments where I got angry about something stupid and reacted in a sort of malicious way. I’m able to sit back and say, that was a totally inappropriate response and you need to apologize. Rather than continuing to feel angry but holding it in and letting everything build up. I think when you do that, you can be more destructive in smaller, more passive aggressive ways but it doesn’t facilitate any kind of communication and it almost perpetuates the behavior because you still feel angry, you feel justified in what you’re doing or saying. It’s also helped me communicate with other people more openly about a lot of things. I’m able to outright say to someone, this upset me, and I know I shouldn’t have reacted that way. But then it starts a conversation of how things can change. This is super rambly and doesn’t really answer your question but it’s as far as I’ve gotten in my own journey.

So don't fault yourself when other people get angry at you. And remember that you are not the only new driver on the road.

Back, relax, etc. All the way to your feet. While laying down you can also lift your head for 10 seconds then relax. Lift your arms for 10 seconds then relax. Lift your legs for 10 seconds then relax. Something is going on. Try to pay attention to any desires, wishing things were different. Hoping for specific things. Any kind of dissatisfaction. Expectations about the future. Only you know what is going on inside of you. Practicing gratitude can help. Remind yourself you have a roof over your head, food to eat.

Humans have something called the ""mammalian diving reflex” that forces the parasympathetic nervous system to kick in, which functions to relax us and calm us down.

In particular, the icy cold water must hit the parts of the face just below the eyes and above the cheekbones for the dive reflex to be activated. When in an extremely heightened state of emotional arousal: * Fill a bowl with icy cold water * Bend/lean over * Hold your breath * Put face in icy cold water for 30 seconds * Make sure that area underneath eyes/above cheekbones (most sensitive part of the face) feels the icy water This technique will calm you down immediately.

It's true a lot of people suffer there but it's such an unfair comparison. It's all about the society we are burn into.

Whenever you are feeling those jealous or non-trustworthy feelings, pull out the list and read it. Add to it. Remember an especially good memory. Give yourself a way to not give bower to those feelings. About the medications, there are many options. I highly suggest trying another. The side effects vary from person to person with each new, even within the same drug class. It is not uncommon to have to try several meds/dosages before finding what works best for you.

I have avoidant personality disorder and that’s caused a lot of similar situations for me. I avoid spending time with my friends and family because part of me is convinced they don’t really like me or that they only invite me places out of pity. When I DO socialize I get preoccupied with saying or doing the “wrong” thing. I crave social interaction yet I steer clear of it. I’ve been working with my therapist to overcome this but it’s hard. Klonopin helps me to be comfortable hanging out in groups but I don’t like to use it often. Another thing that’s helped me is just being open with my close friends about the AVPD issue and trying to spend time with them one on one. That seems to make doing group activities with them a little easier. Good luck!,2019,depression,1,0

Some others think I am dumb and don't know anything because I don't make small talk with them. Because I have almost disconnected myself from the world, whenever I do end up talking with someone, I stutter and stumble and can't structure thoughts correctly in my brain and end up talking nonsense. I constantly feel like I have brain fog. I have tried everything to get rid of my social anxiety, even stuff like nootropics to try and rewire my brain but nothing works.

FWIW, I had a year a lot like yours awhile ago. My dad died, my ex-husband cheated and the woman got pregnant, so I ended up divorced, and I lost two beloved pets. The most helpful thing for me, besides time, was trying to focus on things in my life that were better - to get me through the bad stuff. Do you work, and do you like your job at all? Do you have any hobbies or pastimes you like? Try to focus on things in life that are working right now. I know it seems trivial compared to the losses you've had, but sometimes we have to celebrate the small victories. For me, some days, it was just reading a chapter in a book, or eating a meal that actually tasted good. I think life goes in cycles...we have bad times and then things get better...it's up and down. I wish I could say more to help...your post really touched my heart. Please know you're not alone in feeling this way, but it will pass, and there will be happy times again in your future. Best wishes to you and I hope all turns out well with your kitty!",2019,depression,1,0

"I'm fine. Don't feel the need to force myself to go to a bar or something and have a horrible time, end up barely talking like usual. So, i'm just staying home, none of my friends have asked me if i'd like to join in whatever they're doing. It's not like i'm being left out though, they know that if i want to come out all i have to do is ask. We are all in a groupchat and at least shoot the shit every day a little. The key to feeling OK being in tonight is you can't compare yourself to anyone. Who cares that its NYE, its fuckin overhyped, do what makes you happy. I just finished watching some great MMA fights. Now gonna watch the rest of this hockey game and then i've got a great movie to watch on Netflix that i've saved for now. Oh and a bunch of weed :) Ay, it is what it is, and i know it's not good to isolate yourself, but i bet there's more people than you'd imagine out and about tonight who really would rather stay in if it weren't part of the cultural norm.

"Honestly, I'm virtually in the same exact boat as you right now. I have no advice, but I can share a few things. I understand exactly what you mean by trying to find a reason to stay besides keeping others happy. I don't really have any legitimate friends (aside from one who lives in a different state) or family that would care (apart from my dad), but I'm literally only holding on for him because I know he feels negatively about suicide and death. My friend, on the other hand, would be fine without me tbh. I understand how you feel with your gf and having your mind race constantly and wondering what you said was right or wrong. I don't have a significant other, but there is someone I've found and been close with for the entire year, virtually, and I feel that the person is slipping away from me, although they used to adore me even more thab I adored them, which I never thought was possible! We dont talk frequently atm cause they're really busy, but even before now, I could feel the interest fading, even though they said it wasn't and admitted that they were only stressed out for many understandable reasons. I feel lost without them, and I've grown so dependent and attached to them that Im going through actual withdrawls. Every single day/night I overthink and wonder whether things will get better, or if they'll just walk away like many othershave done, and it keeps me awake nonstop. Even when I do get sleep, I can literally only dream of them and the potential outcomes. Other things are going on in my life that are quit suckish as well, but that's the brunt of it as of now. Also, Ive talked too much, I'm so sorry lol! I really do hope you can find ways to calm yourself, and if I had solid advice that worked for me, I would absolutely tell you, but I'm still trying to figure it out myself.",2019,depression,1,0

"the idea that men don't cry or feel bad when people treat them like shit is bull fucking shit. i'm a trans man who got caught up in it; would rather hit my head against a wall than let myself cry. real sorry about what happened, that was way out of hand and not remotely acceptable. i often make myself out to be the butt of my jokes to deter other people from doing it for me and am kind of a pushover when it comes to letting certain comments slide, and sometimes that comes back to bite me in the ass (i.e. that one pissant who thought it was okay to call me a fucking cuntboy), so i get you. a lot of times it's about setting boundaries, making it clear when people go too far that they've stepped over a line. just being like 'dude, what the fuck?'. it can be hard to assert yourself, but it's something we have to learn. and it's okay to cry. men who repress their feelings too much end up the kind of men who hit their wives after a bad day at work. i think it's way more telling of a real man to be aware of your emotional side and sort out your feelings like a mature adult than it is to push it in the back of your mind and ignore it till you snap. that's just my two cents",2019,mentalhealth,1,0

"Good first step!! __ Your first appointment will not be anything too intense, it's generally just like a consultation where the therapist is trying to understand you and identify what issues you'd like to work on. The deeper you get into it, you're going to share more personal and intimiate things that may trigger a lot of emotions and hopefully get to the source of what's hurting you. It will be difficult, emotionally draining and requires a lot of mental energy and effort. I wish you lotsa luck and don't give up if it gets too painful. Btw also be prepared to need to switch therapists, it's difficult to find one that you are compatible and comfortable with.

My main issue however, is how to help him; as he’s so old school and “stuck in his ways”, that any suggestion of him seeking assistance or talking about his mental well-being is taken as a major insult and taboo.

"I had huge anxiety between 11-16. Then at 16 I have an unknown eye disorder which caused constant pain and it led me to lose all hope. Move foward to when I was 19.

Now I'm 23, just started my first year of University (that's 4 years late) realilty is hitting me hard. I've experienced nothing in life and fell significantly behind others (truthfully I'm behind most 15 year olds in social experience alone). I understand why I did it, but if you seriously want a chance at life try not to completely shut-down and at least hold some little conditions that may give you a foot on the ladder to save youself. If you manage to keep going and escape your family there's a chance you can find happiness, but as someone who also wants to escape his family (and feels pathetic at most normal 23 year olds have moved out by now, never mind those who don't like their family) know that if you do nothing the time just disappears.

"It's really good that you're reaching out. Well done! Even though it's super scary, here's what I'd recommend: Try to book a time with a therapist. If you go to your GP and tell them what you're experiencing, they can help point you in the right direction. I know it's super scary to open up about. However, social anxiety tends to reinforce itself with all sorts of behavioral patterns, so it's usually not really something that'll resolve itself. Kinda takes some work. :) The good thing about talking to your doctor or therapist is, they're looking at it professionally. You don't have to live up to any expectations to them. It's okay to be a crying mess, or to have anxiety, etc... while talking to them. They don't judge you for it. They're there to help you. Perhaps it can even to be helpful to be anxious in front of them, because they are trained in handling it, and helping you gain control. It's a safe space, which is all about you, and talking about all your fears without judgement. Often it helps saying those scary thoughts out loud, you know I'm so glad you reached out to us.

"I've seen it become dangerous when people with schizophrenia do illicit drugs instead of being properly treated. One girl that I knew was also doing cocaine and meth while she was going through frequent episodes. She appeared as a stereotypical, dangerous schizophrenic because she had picked holes all over herself, didn't have good hygiene, and formed strange fixations on people. Pair this with amphetamines and you might have someone that is sporadically violent. She had even gotten to a point that she targeted and attacked children. It was almost like her double life, because when her episodes calmed down, she cleaned up well and became extremely promiscuous. She would hook up with men who I knew would never be caught dead with her if they were aware of her behavior. They could never guess, on their own, however. I think a good topic to touch on would be treatment awareness. Participating in your treatment is key. Someone who suffers from schizophrenia is still capable of self-awareness and self-control and a large reason as to why many people with schizophrenia suffer from stigma from their peers is because they, themselves, choose not to participate in treatment and/or abuse their medications or drugs.

"I’ve been a manager for many years and I have pretty bad social anxiety so I thought to answer this. First and foremost, go for it. Don’t let your anxiety weigh you down because all you’re doing is fearing the what-ifs that haven’t happened. Your management style will dictate a lot of your experience. There are different managers... some lead by fear and some lead through loyalty. Either motivates employees to a degree, but for me, I always chose to lead through loyalty. For one, I avoid more conflict that way... but also, I find it’s easier to get the results you want when employees actually want to do things for you as opposed to them doing it mainly because they fear for their job. That being said, your SA will actually come in handy here. You don’t want the conflict, so don’t create it. Yes, you’re going to have employees here and there who push your buttons... you’re going to have a swell of anxiety there and you’ll have to take care of that in time. But if you cultivate loyalty, those instances will be few and far between. And I guarantee you, by being a genuinely good manager, you won’t regret having to deal with employees that blatantly disrespect you as a human being. They’re dicks and deserve what comes to them. Your SA will also keep you somewhat aloof and you probably won’t appear too friendly - which is perfect, because while you want loyal employees, you don’t want overly comfortable employees. Again, focus on being a fair, just manager. Lead by example. Don’t worry about making friends. People will perceive you as someone they would want to impress ... and they will follow you naturally.",2019,socialanxiety,1,0

"I took Lexapro for a few years for panic attacks/general anxiety/depression in high school. Lexapro, combined with CBT, brought me from a mental breakdown to a normal, happy person again. While I still had anxiety and depression, I was able to attempt to cope with it - I couldn’t do anything to help myself before. The panic attacks also almost entirely disappeared. At this time, I would’ve been classified as a high-functioning individual - I was doing remarkably well at school, had friends and a boyfriend, actively involved at school, etc etc - I was just (convincingly) hiding how miserable I was. I had two qualms with Lexapro. The first was that it made me incredibly tired, which got better over time, but I could not function on less than 9 hours of sleep. Also, my libido was squashed to zero. I went off of Lexapro because I foolishly thought I didn’t need it anymore, had a stint on Prozac where I had cyclothymic episodes and really fell apart, and then went on Citalopram (Celexa), a very chemically similar pill to Lexapro.

Besides, it would be very surprising if anxiety about color was the weirdest thing a therapist had heard. Sorry I don't have more insight on anxiety about color specifically.

"I can say that I completely understand where you're coming from. It was a struggle for me to get to be where i am with being happy in life and with myself. And some days, it's harder then others. The first step for me was accepting the fact that bad things happen and sometimes life is going to make you upset. This kinda plays in to the ""other people have it worse then me"". Your problems in life are just as important as the next persons. You can't compare other people's problems to your own. Everyone reacts and feels differently. What might be a minor problem to you may be a traumatic experience for me. (Ex. Public speaking. Some people love it where as I cant even imagine it with out feeling nauseous) Its important to learn that your problems matter. Your not over exaggerating them. However, staying stuck on those problems wont help you achieve happiness. There are some things in life that you cant fix or change. Sometimes horrible things happen to us, and it hurts a lot, but the best we can do is accept and learn from it. That doesnt mean it will make the situation any better. Infact, it probably wont, but it will help lift a weight off your chest and slightly ease your mind. Though I said this was the first step, its probably one of the hardest, because your taking away that barrier you built to protect yourself. You have to admit to yourself that you hurt and you struggle. Next is rewiring your brain. I get made fun of all the time by my coworkers because I try to be so optimistic. I always try to find the bright side to things. Some people just aren't like this. But I think its crucial to being happy. You have to look for the good in the bad, but dont ignore the bad. Sorry I know it's kinda confusing, but basically, its the same as before. Accept that bad things happen, but now look on the other side, how is it not bad. So the best example I have is pretty fresh and I'm still struggling pretty hard with it. So several months back, my now ex boyfriend shot himself. He did survive but after a month passed he broke up with me and got a new girlfriend. We hadn't been dating long but I really loved him. I was, and am, completely lost right now on the situation. However, I know I cant just focus on the things I dont understand or have any control over. Hes alive and happy with another girl. Sure it sucks that it isnt me, but I'm happy that hes happy. But yeah, this situation is a little extreme so I hope you kinda get at what I'm trying to say with all of this... Now let's talk about your struggle to reach out about your mental health. Talk to someone. Parents, siblings, friends, teachers, HR, or even you doctor. You mental health the most important thing. Especially of you're trying to ""live a happy life "". YOU ARE NOT A BUTDEN! Any one who says you are, cut them out of your life. You dont need that B.S. You are important and trust me, people care about you. Maybe your friends, family, immediate support group, wont understand, but there are people out there who will. And if they don't, they will try to understand because they care about you. I highly recommend going to a therapist. If you dont want to talk about your mental health, then talk about how you want to be happy but you're not sure how to get there. Being happy isnt as easy as flipping a swich. And even when you do reach that state where 99% of the time you're happy, you dont always have to be smiling and cheery. Everyone has their bad days and everyone struggles. You're allowed to be sad, mad, angry, and hurt. But you have to keep moving on and not stay there. Acknowledged your feelings, confront them, and then keep going. Sorry I'm not sure this will really help much. I'm not really got at collecting my thoughts and giving advice. But I really hope this in some way helps you.",2019,mentalhealth,1,0

This is an excellent idea. You are showing a lot of courage here. Praise yourself for that. The first day you're probably going to go a little nuts and wonder what you've gotten yourself into. I'd like to tell you everyday gets a little bit better every day but you've probably seen those charts that show improvement where the progress goes up and down like crazy. It's like that. The important thing is how you handle the emotions. Whether you tell yourself they make you miserable or they're making you grow you're right. Welcome the anxiety and let yourself feel it. Relax into it. Having anxiety doesn't mean there's a problem you need to solve. It's a feeling like any other. Feel it and let it go. Every time you do you get better. It may not seem like it but that's how it works.,2019,socialanxiety,1,0
You will make as much progress as you put in work. When you get into the habit of putting in the work and you start praising yourself for every little bit of progress it starts to become fun.

"I'm not going to detail everything that happened to me but I will say that I have spoken my last words and know how that anger is on a whole other level; simply existing is a fight against the universe itself and you feel like you could bend steel with your bare hands even though you're too weak to drag yourself to the bathroom for a piss. That anger is part of the person you needed to be to survive, but it's not part of the person you need to be to *live*. Everyone talks about how great it is that you're still alive, that the worst is over, but the real fight starts after they let you out. That's the moment you realize what worked in there doesn't work anywhere else, and it's so hard to let go of those feelings because you *know* they kept you alive. Here's where things might sound a little odd... personify your anger. Like, literally imagine a person or creature who represents that rage and have a full on conversation in your head. Thank them for keeping you alive, ask the questions you need to ask and relieve them of their duty for now. Make peace with those feelings, essentially. As for books, pick up Deep Survival by Laurence Gonzales. It's not a self-help book at all, it's just a bunch of true stories and observations about the experience of surviving but I found it cathartic to see those same emotions mirrored in other people's experiences. It helped to see it implied that my feelings were normal.",2019,Anger,1,0

"I have SA. College was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life. Think about it... every other Freshman there is experiencing it for the first time. There will be a ton of other people there with anxiety going through the same stuff, and it can really help you build a bond with people and make friends for life. College is also a lot less cliquey than high school. This is a little judgy and crappy to say, but typically the type of people who would most likely “make fun” of you are weeded out in high school. Intelligence doesn’t correlate with being a jerk, but it certainly correlates to going to college and how well people do on average. Just try not to use alcohol/drugs too much as a social crutch. Remember that the end goal is to come away with a degree that you can use to live a better life. College is the point in time when your ability to build good habits starts to matter, because you don’t have the family’s routine controlling you any more. I can honestly say of all the periods of my life, my SA was basically non-existent in college. Maybe that’s not the norm, but that was my experience.",2019,socialanxiety,1,0

"Last year I went into a KFC, which is no problem for someone who doesn’t get really anxious in social situations, but for me it was a challenge. There was a lot of people in there and I could just feel their eyes on me. I was really nervous for a few minutes, but then I realised that I had nothing to be nervous about after I saw that all those people were just as nervous as me. During this Summer I went to the movies to see the new Mission Impossible movie and I felt great knowing that I was conquering my fears for the first time. After that I did more things that I couldn’t think of doing before. When people say “just put yourself in more uncomfortable situations”, they’re right.

"I hope you can look at this later and realize how strange it is that something so small was ever so big (in your head). I've beaten back my anxiety in the last decade (although the job absolutely isn't done yet) so I can look back at the things that were huge challenges when I was younger and that I now do suppressing a yawn. I remember a full day being ruined because I knew I had to place a food order in a busy cafetaria. It was this impending cloud of doom over a complete day, and I remember walking in the place with sweaty hands in my pockets, head down, heartbeat at treadmill level, and me just sputtering the words out like I was confessing to a crime or something. Now it's a menial task that I do while my mind wanders, and that's just a couple of years difference. As you may know, progress like that doesn't come from conceptually understanding things, you can't reason yourself to less anxiety. But it's not meaningless either: it helps to know certain things, makes it a lot easier. Like ppl ITT have been saying, visualizing works, I also find mindfulness helps, understanding that the fear is just noise and you have to focus on the signal instead, etc. But what's needed to overcome the fear is doing it, and doing it again, until you realize how easy it actually is. That sort of realization only comes through practice, like with every other form of anxiety. I always compare it to driving, merging onto the highway is scary the first time, but with the right mind set going into it, do it 50 times and it's easy. Good luck tomorrow!",2019,socialanxiety,1,0

"I’d say that context is key here. Hear me out here cause this might be a bit long-winded. The dictionary gives a definition of quite meaning “to an extreme”; for me, common parlance has never really adopted that meaning. Lots of people use it differently. Quite is quite vague in that sense and the vagueness causes issues. Which I guess is why you posted! I’d say the word can have the effect you describe, at least it can cause the receiving party to interpret it that way, simply because it can seem to quantise something which otherwise would simply be a binary choice. If you were to tell someone you were dating that they are handsome, you’re still in that dichotomy of handsome or not handsome; the person would know that you’re asserting positively that they are handsome, as opposed to not being handsome, which is always nice to hear __ If you were to say that they are “quite handsome”, well! You’ve just stepped out of the simple binary “handsome or not” dichotomy and you are now on a spectrum of handsomeness! You’re implying through language that they are measurably handsome and that they are obviously handsome to _some_ degree. But to what degree? How handsome is “quite”? Is it handsome enough? “Quite” becomes a term relative to the individual and their own neuroses. Tl;dr there are better reinforcing/emphasising words you can use to emphasise things than “quite”; similarly there are better words to diminish the significance. Hope that made sense! This is all just my opinion. Just remember your audience and if you can avoid using “quite” and use clearer terms like “very” and “really”, or “somewhat” if you’re detracting, then your message will come across quite clearly __",2019,socialanxiety,1,0

"I've never had panic attacks as often or as rough as it sounds like you do, but my best advice is to force yourself to relax. Find someplace comfortable, like your bed but honestly wherever works, someplace kind of removed, where your mind will gradually calm down and get distracted even. I find watching YouTube videos or even traffic often can achieve this for me. My friend also taught me a pretty good method for calming down in the moment - ground yourself. I don't remember what the exact numbers were, but you run through it in your mind: five things you're hearing right now, four things you're seeing right now, three things you're touching right now, two things you're smelling right now, one thing you're tasting, and repeat. It may not work for you, but it's the best I've got :/ For long term, though, it's the quintessential answer: find someone. Is your friend willing to recognize when you're on the edge and try to deescalate the situation? Is there anyone willing to let you release or vent to them? And, of course, access to a psychologist or other mental healthcare is often the best solutions, if you can afford or access it.

"Anger and depression are two sides of the same coin. They can have the exact same source. Your emotions just manifest differently over time depending on what is going on for you. Feeling like you want to run away is literally the fight or flight response. When you're in a tight knot like that it can feel like you don't have any options. See if you can try to expand your perspective. What if you were your best friend looking at you from fifty feet away? What advice would you give yourself based on your current situation. We would need more information to figure out what is happening. You're right, the drinking is a symptom, not the ailment. But in the long run drinking doesn't help. That's why they call it ""self-medicating"" - it doesn't work. Do you have any favorite authors? Reading can be a good escape. Exercising a couple times a week - doesn't matter what it is. Renew your old hobbies if that's an option. Finding a healthy distraction helps alleviate things. Make sure you are getting rest. Get good sleep. Take a nap on the weekends just for the heck of it. Being tired and bleary eyed at work just adds to overall stress. Would you consider seeing a therapist? It's a chance to talk to a trained professional face to face who has experience helping people work through challenges like this. Be extra patient and kind to yourself and others while you're figuring things out. I've been in therapy a long time and I keep going because it has helped me. So I'm an advocate.",2019,Anger,1,0

"I'm in the same situation and refuse to go to AA or anything that engages in religious stuff. I haven't quite mastered my own issues so I have very little for you other than I recently realized that I'm less likely to drink a lot if I find things I really like to do to replace the addiction with. Fishing for example, picked it back up after years of not fishing and since then I'm kinda nuts for it, and when it isn't cold out I'm extremely active and outside. Same with biking, and combining biking and fishing etc. Some people do it with the gym because they replace the comfort of an alcohol buzz with the euphoria of endorphines. I'll probably never quit smoking weed. I know you don't want to hear about subreddits but /r/stopdrinking is great inspiration.",2019,Anger,1,0
"Hi. I can relate. I drank for about a year as a teenager when I was living outdoors. Alcohol helped me to stop thinking about why my mom couldn't kick her abusive boyfriend out. I left after he started threatening me. Alcohol has always made me feel sick, but it took away the anxiety of interacting with people. I quit drinking from sixteen to twenty - two. I spent about a year binge drinking when I lived in a college town where it was all that anyone have a shit about. I stopped again after having a drunk panic attack. Alcohol is a worthless poison to me. Weed, on the other hand, was suggested to me by my doctor. It has helped me an awful lot with my constant muskuloskeletal pain. I have a rare genetic condition that basically makes me a circus freak. I feel conflicted about smoking. It works for me, keeps me from having to use narcotic painkillers, but I feel guilt about it. Like, it's not an adult thing to be doing. I struggle with worrying that people will think I'm a dumb pothead, lazy, etc. I'm in my thirties. My anger has really taken over in the last ten years. I grew up with a tyrant father who ridiculed my emotions, tricked me into getting in trouble and really enjoyed hurting me. He conditioned me into believing that the way to live life is to let people treat me like shit while kissing their assess. This is no way to live. My anger tends to get the best of me when people are being unreasonable, acting the way he used to. I've learned to recognize when people are taking advantage of my caring nature and to speak up. I've learned to say ""I don't like the way you treat me."" I've ended a couple of friendships when people have flipped out at that statement. It's so simple and human, but many people refuse to be accountable for their thoughts, feelings and actions. The one area this hasn't worked is with my mother in law. She has a lot of issues, one being twenty plus years of Xanax. She is a hoarder and expects us to follow her unhealthy coping strategies. It's been so hard. I followed this sub in order to gain some more skills for my coping toolbox. It seems that many people don't have a way to release the day to day stress and anger that builds up inside. It helps for me to read the experiences and reach out. It helps me to focus and think logically about how to deal in the moment. Have you considered Emotions Anonymous? If you've got a handle on the drinking, a support group for intense emotions may be key. People can definitely relate to you. Some of the things I do when I'm feeling the yucky angry feelings help. I excuse myself to my car sometimes and listen to very loud music that I can scream along to. I'm the car, nobody can hear what I'm screaming. Sometimes I turn up Marilyn Manson and just scream ""WHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHY?!!"" About ten minutes of this releases the energy I was afraid would make me lose it. Once in a while, I buy a couple of fragile things from the thrift or dollar store and go smash the crap out of them with an aluminum baseball bat. When it's not so intense, I throw some stones into the river or an empty field. Anger is a unique emotion. It serves a purpose, but it's so hard to control. It's hard to predict and it's addictive. I do my best not to give in to the seduction. It really does feel good sometimes to unload on someone who is bullying someone else. I think it's wonderful that you recognize what comes up from the past when you're angry. Shitty fathers are a big deal. I think abusive dads are what started the punk rock movement. Some of my idols are important to me because they made me feel like I wasn't a weirdo for my experiences. Check out some Henry Rollins, Black Flag. Let the anger have a place to exist so it doesn't show up uninvited to the emotions party. You're really clued in. Lots of people just don't give a shit that their behavior makes people want to avoid them. Being able to talk about your anger is wonderful. What do you do when you feel the adrenaline rising?",2019,Anger,1,0

"Healthy distractions are how we all get through the difficult parts. Exercise, hobbies, staring out the window, reading a book, drawing, writing. You have high standards for yourself and others. Channel this into a creative outlet. But give everyone else and yourself a break. Use your high standards for what you make or write or how you talk to people. Lower your standards when they are unreasonable. This means you have to take time to look at them. What kinds of assumptions are you making? On a daily basis take a look at the thoughts, feelings, emotions you are having and listen to them. What kind of ""should"" statements are you hearing yourself say a lot? ""I should be able to do that, I should be better than that, They should understand me better."" These kinds of statements are almost always underscored by unreasonable or unrealistic assumptions. It's not easy to figure them out in the moment but you can write them down at the time and then evaluate them after you've had time to cool down and reflect. Keeping a [thought journal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201404/how-keep-thought-diary-combat-anxiety) for this purpose can help. Nobody can read your mind and you can't read theirs. We have to speak or use body language to get communication across. So speak clearly and often. Maybe more than you think you should. Be explicit when there is doubt. Criticism is a trigger for anger too. Try not to criticize others too much because it makes them defensive. When someone criticizes us, and we reel back and come up with a sarcastic thing to say, that's us being defensive too. So to counter that in ourselves, when we hear criticism it helps to turn it into a request. ""Why do you always have to leave dirty dishes in the sink?!"" Pause. What's the content of this statement? What they're really wanting is for us to rinse the major stuff off and go ahead and put the dishes in the dishwasher without being asked every time. If we can't figure out what it is - ask. Instead of being defensive or sarcastic, listen well to what they are saying and keep asking sincerely. This is [active listening](https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm) and it helps both ways, for them and us. But for your current problem - I have to admit an ex-girlfriend dating your roommate is brutal. You really want to remedy that by getting a new roommate. Whether that involves asking him to leave or you moving out. I could see myself getting homicidal/suicidal over something like that. And there are stories in the newspaper every day about people getting killed over exes. So you want to do something about that pronto. I would recommend just moving out to another place. You'll get a fresh perspective. You could possible live on another side of town in a different neighborhood you can explore. Move within walking distance of a gym, grocery store and bus or train line used to be my thing. That way I could do a lot of reasonable distance walking (since I have asthma) and not even need a car. You should basically be able to see them by walking a block or two in either direction of your place. I recommend moving this weekend. Get your stuff packed before you even bring it up. Check online to see what hardware stores sell boxes cheap. In the US it's Lowes (much cheaper than Ace, Staples or other places). See if another friend can help you move. Someone with a van, preferably that doesn't know them. Call your regular doctor and ask for a referral for a therapist. They will call you back with a name and number for you. Then you just call the new therapist/psychiatrist to set up the new appointment. Or you can use your insurance website to look one up directly. Sometimes you can find one closer to you that way and you don't have to drive so far to see them. Hang in there!",2019,Anger,1,0

Some might not take you seriously at first but if you can avoid blowing up at these people (like I do) you can probably accomplish this task and keep your job while earning the respect of your colleagues.

"I know how it feels, to be at the bottom of the bottom of the school hierarchy. One time when I was forced to play football and everyone got into groups.

I was the weird quiet kid and was constantly pushed around at all times during the day. Sports was always the worst. In the changing rooms people would throw shoes at me, spray deodorant in my face and mock my body. All I could think was “Fucking knuckle dragging animals”. I’ve left that school now but it left me with a permeant scar. My anger and hatred for that school will forever burn inside. I’m a better person now than the pushover I used to be. But the anger never goes, for how I was treated and how it fucked me up. I’m going to be honest, all I want is for them to all die horrible slow deaths. People like that don’t deserve to live.

"No one ever acknowledges a hong except by honking back. These are my road rage rules for myself that I keep editing as I learn new things: 1. Leave 20 minutes early for everything. No excuses! Being late or even just (barely) on time can be hugely stressful. Drive bored (not angry). Arrive early with time to cool out instead of showing up late and raging on negative energy. 2. Drive within 5 miles of the speed limit. This might be the hardest one since we often need to drive with the flow of traffic when we're surrounded by a group going fast. But the point is to not add stress to your driving by speeding. 3. If someone puts their blinker on, let them do what they want to do. Let them pass, let them change lanes. When someone speeds up to pass you, do not speed up to block them! This will make them panic and it serves no purpose. So what if they pass you? People who fly past us end up sitting next to us at the nest stop light. In the long run it doesn't matter. 4. Don't even try to guess why people drive the way they do. We cannot control them and we can't possibly know their reasons for changing lanes, speeding up or slowing down. We can only control ourselves. But this is where our power is! 5. You have a choice! You can choose how you want to feel while you’re driving. If you don’t like what is happening, back off. Disengage. For the sake of yourself and your partner. Drive how you want to feel. Put some soothing music on. Or not! But you are in control of how you feel when you are in your own car. Do not try to communicate with hand gestures or faces. The only communication techniques you need to use to be safe are brake lights and blinkers. 6. If someone starts tailgating you very gently apply your brakes. Not aggressively! Gently. Just enough to have your brake lights come on and slow the car a little. This is to communicate you are not going to speed up just because they don't think you're going fast enough. This is not a brake check which is a very aggressive move. Never brake check people, it sends them immediately into road rage. They will almost always go around you when they can at their next available opportunity. When they pass you, let them pass you. Do not speed up or try to block them! This part is critical. If you do any of those things you are engaging in road rage. When you stop doing those things you are committing to driving the way you want to feel - calm, safe and cool. Good luck and drive safely.",2019,Anger,1,0
"It could happen when video games become your 'life'. I saw the story of a guy that was top Pokemon Go player in the US. When he was late to a raid, he would scream obscenities at the top of his head in the street. He saw his value as a human being completely attached to his video game ranking. If his ranking fell, he would enrage and be depressed. Anger come from frustration. You think things should happen one way (you should win a match), but they don't (you lose). Maybe you invested hundreds of hours in this game and YET you still get killed and lose. Makes you feel like a loser in real-life. There will always be better people than you in video games. ALWAYS. Some people play a hundred hours a week. They have no life. Some people cheat with bots. My advice would be to try to understand in your life why and how video games became so important to you as a human being. There are other things in life that you can be proud of. Video games today are designed specifically to make them addictive like heroin or cocaine. They hit the brain pathway for reward and feel-good feelings. A new achievement, a new high-score. Consider playing less, and not attach your value as a human being to your score or achievements in games. Ultimately games don't matter. It should be a past-time. Games won't get you a job, useful knowledge, or healthy relationships. Make sure you take care of yourself. Go out, exercise; drink less sugary drinks and caffeinated drinks.

"I used to hit myself in the head everytime I got mad, particularly at video games. It ended up getting bad enough to the point I concussed myself a couple times.

Over time I learned to address my problems in a healthy manor, and I’m sure you will as well, but what really helped me was putting things in perspective. When you get angry while playing the game just put the controller down, take a breath, and remind yourself that it is only a game. Sometimes I would get so caught up in the game I would forget that it’s just a game. I’m not gonna win every single time. No one wins every single time.

Remind him that even though he's working on it he will still have episodes. Instead of looking at these incidents as setbacks or relapses, he can look at them as learning experiences. Tell him, ""don't beat yourself up about it, because getting mad at yourself for getting mad only prolongs it,"" etc. Review the incident and see what he can glean from it to try and anticipate and intervene with himself next time. Did he start out agitated that day or was it abrupt? Did it involve someone else? Remember [smaller emotions](http://feelingswheel.com/) build up into the strong negative ones, so pay attention to the smaller ones as well. You know that exercise. Tell him to give it three to six months. So his goal is to review what happened with each incident to find ways to make it shorter each time between getting mad and coming back down. There are many different format worksheets for this purpose for anger, ocd, ptsd such as [this worksheet](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/PTSDThoughtRecordSheet.pdf). I personally customized this for myself and you're welcome to use it if you can [download it from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ly6bi0br8x2ehx5/Anger%20Management%20-%20Reflection%20Worksheet.pdf?dl=0). Remind him the real work happens between sessions. So keeping a notebook where he writes things that happened down and evaluate them to see if he can come up with a way to prevent an outburst is his homework. He should bring this with him each session so you can go over it with him and maybe make additional suggestions or find insights he's missing. Do you think he would be willing to do that? Anyway, hope these ideas help. PS if you ever have a female patient with anger issues, [The Dance of Anger](https://www.amazon.com/Dance-Anger-Changing-Patterns-Relationships/dp/0062319043) is a great one. I wish there was a book like this for men. Just as a caution, do not recommend meditation.

You can have anger because it seemed like a preventable accident. You might have feelings of guilt over not being able to protect the cat. Or want revenge. Listen to your quieter feelings that come up. Practice forgiving everyone that was there that night, including yourself. “Practice” just means saying out loud or just to yourself compassionate things like, “I forgive the people who were setting off fireworks”, “I forgive myself for not being able to stop what happened.” “I loved my cat and I know s/he is at peace now.” “If I have a pet again all I can do is my best to care for it and show it my love.”",2019,Anger,1,0

Sometimes it's how we're raised. I wasn't allowed to show anything and then decades later realized I had a huge anger problem. What helps is allowing ourselves to feel again. Allow yourself to feel the smaller [emotions](http://feelingswheel.com/). Because they're the ones that lead up to anger. Smaller things like frustration, disappointment can pool up and be the source for larger anger. So at the same time you want to let the anger cool off, you want to say it's ok to feel things. Let yourself feel things. But take proactive measures when you are starting to feel strong negative emotions. Stand up, look out the window, pace a little bit, stretch out your neck or hands, get a glass of water, go to another room, go for a walk, count to 10 breathing slowly (or count to 100 fast without worrying about the breathing). &gt; It started with gaming.

"Well first of all brother, good on you for admitting your anger has a stronghold in your life. The first step to getting help is admitting you need it. I have four kids, 7, 4 4 and 4. I get mad frequently at all the bickering and constant babbling and helicoptering they do, but I’m just now learning how to cope. For me, I do enjoy peace and quiet and I’ve thought for the longest that if my kids just shut up for two minutes, I’d feel a whole lot better. Well, there’s been a couple of instances for work where I don’t see them all day and it breaks my heart, I miss them terribly, but the very next morning, when their bickering and whining starts back up, so does my anger. I’ve recently started going to a therapist for my anger as it’s affecting my marriage, my relationship with my kids, and my inner peace. I confided a lot of person things that I haven’t told many people, such as the fact I was sexually abused multiple times as a child. My therapist pointed out that children that are abused in some way shape or form can often times grow up angry. I never put two and two together. I’ve never sought help from my childhood, but I sure as hell didn’t think me getting angry at my children’s mouth noises and my being abused as a child having any correlation whatsoever. But, after talking a bit more with my therapist and trying to pick apart my wounds, I’ve started to take steps towards a healthier and less angry approach to my kids. I’m not saying I have answers or that you were abused, I just recommend possibly getting some professional help. There may be some underlying causes to the anger that you never would have discovered on your own. Good luck brother.",2019,Anger,1,0

"My husband’s tone and volume when he’s losing at video games scare the cat and kitty runs to another room. I find his video game anger to be super irritating and the fact that he’s so involved in the game to not care how he affects the mood of the household is baffling to me. I hate it and I don’t know how to bring it up in the moment without him being pissy because he’s already mad at his game. It feels childish and not at all self aware. My husband’s game anger rarely aimed at me and I get that it’s frustrating for him, but in your situation, I suggest you think about how your tone and volume affect the entire mood of your home. To me, it feels selfish that you dominate arguments vocally and emotionally. I can’t really do that with my voice but you can. You are hurting your family or partner and making your emotions and points more important by yelling. Being able to breathe and control your tone are important.

"I don't think it is bipolar. I am definitely not bipolar and get much the same thing. It's actually what I came on to discuss. One of the suggestions I have heard for it is that depression might be self-directed anger. We are angry and feel like we can't be, so we turn it on ourselves instead and the anger and loathing we feel toward ourselves comes out as depression. We get reinvigorated by external anger because it's a blessed moment of being able to turn all those emotions outward again. Which is why we leap right to epic revenge fantasies. I'm not sure if it is true but it makes some sense to me. Especially since I rarely feel anger and depression at the same time, it is either or, and they can swing into each other back and forth. Because I'll get angry. Feel guilty. Get depressed that I'm awful person. Mope for a while. Then get (re-)exposed to whatever makes me upset and just want to fucking destroy it and that's all I can think about it until the guilt at what an awful person I must be to think these things creeps back in. So I sort of suspect the anger is an expression of the same thing that our depression is. It's an amalgamation of us misplacing our feelings and not knowing how to deal with them. There's some third thing we're not dealing with because we can't see it or don't know how. That's my best guess anyway :/",2019,Anger,1,0

Twofold problem: the first is stress! You’re having panic attacks. Have you seen a therapist? Or even just your regular doctor. They could give you something to take that’s just for when you feel a meltdown coming on like a sedative like Xanax (which you don’t want to mix with alcohol btw) or something similar. Talk to them and get a referral for a therapist too. Just talking things out with a professional a few sessions might help. You don’t have to take any meds if you don’t want to. The second part is anger is a symptom of all the frustration and hardship you’re dealing with. Can you lower your monthly expenses? I know it’s not easy but often more doable than increasing your paycheck. Check out r/povertyfinance for tips and maybe post your situation. Could you get your rent down lower?

It’s okay to be mad. It’s okay to still wonder why. But you know what’s not okay? Staying in that place. I don’t know how I did it, but eventually I turned depression, suicidal thoughts, and crying for hours on end in my lonely apartment into some major ass kicking motivation. I lost weight and worked out excessively, I obsessed over it more than anything, I felt great about myself, I felt more confident.

Like yes, my ex wife took my kids, yes she took my car, yes she left for another man, yes my house was empty, yes my heart was empty, yeah my life really sucked and there were nights I didn’t think I’d wake up, but every waking moment I forced myself to get better at something. Eventually I craved it. I craved excellence for myself. Wanna know what happened? I caught the attention of the most drop dead gorgeous, intelligent, graceful woman to ever grace the damn planet. Want to know what else happened? My ex’s stupid plans to rip my kids out away from me collapsed on her.

"Could he possibly have soft bipolar — bipolar 2? Obligatory disclaimer: I am totally not a professional, just a mental health bystander who knows how hard it is to be properly diagnosed. That being said, a symptom of bipolar is taking medication until you’ve built a tolerance to it, then the medication starts to trigger episodes of mania. This is my understanding but some good old fashioned research might turn up better answers. I’m personally in the mix of being diagnosed between ADHD, major depression, PTSD/CPTSD, and potentially bipolar type 2. They all look and act really similar, but they’re curious about me being bipolar because I can only tolerate certain medications for a few months before my tolerance betrays me and I’m acting worse than I was before. With each of these diagnoses, anger is a major compound. Deciding which medication will do what and for how long has been a struggle. Trying to find the right medication for multiple things could be easy or really, really hellish for some people. I’m sorry if I’m not steering you in the right direction! I hope you all find relief, this isn’t an easy situation for anyone. Edit: I also wanted to say that sometimes this type of answer makes those troubled situations easier. It could be something else entirely but, I know that for me, it shifted my thinking from “you should probably hate yourself because you’re an angry piece of crap” to “hey so your brain isn’t balancing out as it should so little things become big problems and there’s medicine for that.” Way easier to chew on and love myself through, instead of thinking I was making everyone I loved miserable for no reason.",2019,Anger,1,0

"Exact same problem here. Having someone teach me helps a lot, with maths it tend to be the helpless feeling that sets me off. I am taking a intensive math course aswell currently and I have had a couple rages this year. When my cousin or classmate help me with it I never turn into rage mode though. Probably has something to do with social pressure but also with the fact that I dont feel helpless because I understand the concepts 100times faster. Try finding someone who can help you or pay someone to help you understand the concepts that you tend to find difficult. Maths are hard as fuck man. I did an IQ score recently and scored 111 which is pretty decent. (Not trying to show off, read further) But currently learning the same maths 15 year olds on the highest education are learning while I am almost 21 myself. 80% of the concepts are really hard for me eventhough I score quite high in the problemsolving things in an IQ test.

"I'm glad you got the help you needed and that you've seen progress. I remember how for me, it was like finally waking up after being drunk for years and seeing how I'd behaved-- this horrible feeling of sort of thinking ""I did *what*?! How messed up *was* I?!"" As others have said, making changes and accepting responsibility is huge. It's beyond difficult to just accept that you don't get to make some mistakes right, and I applaud you for coming to that conclusion yourself. It feels terrible, and it stinks, but it is that final bit of accepting that you need to make changes, and a sign that they're sticking with you. For whatever little it's worth-- it's easy to get stuck in a rut of despair when you realize that you can't make things right again. You just sort of focus on what you did wrong, how foolish it feels more, and how much you wish you could turn back time and knock some sense into your past self. You're pushing for the past rather than living for the present, and it's a natural, unhealthy instinct. The bad news is that we never get to change the past. The good news is that we do get to define ourselves by our future. You don't forgive yourself quickly or easily for the wrongs that you visited on others and, in that process, yourself. But eventually you accept that you're no longer the sort of person who would make those same hurtful actions, and that the people in your life-- new or old-- recognize that you're a changed, better person for it, and you can let go. It sounds like you're still in the early days. Healing takes time, and you won't get there quickly or easily. But you will one day. It gets good again, and I promise, it's an incredible feeling when you get there and can accept that you're better than you were.",2019,Anger,1,0

"TL;DR - Practice forgiving those around you but don't give up on your goal of having the job you want. Anger management techniques are all about communication. How we communicate with our partners, family, friends and of course ourselves. It might sound weird to talk about how we ""communicate with ourselves"" but we can get angry in a room alone just by how we manage and react to our thoughts. So it's our internal dialogue that is 50% of what we need to focus on in addition to working with other people. You have already noticed how seemingly trivial things cause you to blow up. This is the classic indicator that we have a problem with how we handle anger so it's a great thing for you to be observing. Most of us on here (r/anger) got here by noticing that or from hitting things or uncontrollable bouts of rage. He just wants recognition. Men are like puppies. We just want to hear ""good boy, job well done"" and we feel better. Men don't do well with shame. Shame is a tough one because, sorry for continuing this metaphor, but it makes us feel like we're in the dog house. And only a little bit will put us in a bad mood. So try not to chastise him if it's something trivial. And take it easy on yourself, especially the next couple fo weeks. Getting mad at yourself for getting mad only makes the anger last longer than necessary. Anger is an emotion and we want to listen to our emotions. Trying to shut them off, ignore them, push it down, will always make it worse. So acknowledge anger when it comes up as soon as you can. Especially see if you can notice smaller thoughts, feelings, emotions that come up like frustration, disappointment, stress, etc. Pay attention to them and just acknowledge them. It helps to keep a [thought journal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201404/how-keep-thought-diary-combat-anxiety) to learn how to evaluate them in a positive light. You don't have to write a lot, just enough to see what you can get out of what you are thinking and feeling about what is happening at the moment. You can grab any college ruled type notebook and write today's date and then what is on your mind. What helps is you can try to clearly write down what happened and how you felt. With practice we can remember and write down the progression and often see what it was that really got us fired up even though it just seemed like it was about ""shampoo"" at the time. Going back and reflecting on it in an hour or two when you've cooled down helps with this. Just writing stuff down helps me feel better too, like I'm starting to unwind the knot of anger. When I can't sleep, I jot down the things that are rolling around in my head and that helps too. I can forget it and go to sleep but it will still be there tomorrow for me to remember and reflect. Protecting your sleep is a huge benefit for anger sufferers. I do this type of journaling/diary keeping in addition to therapy and it has helped me a lot. Resentment is a very strong negative emotion. It leads directly to anger if you consider its position on this [chart of emotions](http://feelingswheel.com/). I imagine it can also lead to the need for revenge or to get even somehow. You're a perfectionist. You have high standards for yourself and expect others to be able to do the same. This makes your anger particularly intense. So you want to acknowledge that people can make mistakes. And that you would benefit from being even more forgiving of your close family and friends. Because they're the ones that, by proximity, are automatically in direct line to receive the most heat from you. Even when the anger is justified, you want to choose between refusing to let it go and opting for vengeance, or choosing to lower your overall anger on a regular basis and choose forgiveness and compassion. It's ok for people to make mistakes. He can't read your mind and you can't read his. We have to talk to each other. That's the first law of communication. Be explicit. And drop arguing for arguing's sake. [Active listening](https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm) (video halfway down the page) can help with this by replacing the need to come up with a snappy, sarcastic response with listening for the purpose of understanding. This one was tough for me so I'll just add it. Try not to be right all the time. Being right in a long term relationship is a reward that only fuels anger. Let him be right on purpose a few times in the next week just to see what it feels like. The world will not come to an abrupt end. Why not? Because the truth is you can both be right. You can both have your own opinion. The goal isn't for you to win or him to win. The goal is to come to an agreement in a way that works for both of you. Active listening helps with this as well because you can negotiate a better outcome if you take the time to listen and understand each other. There's the book [Getting Together and Staying Together](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Together-Staying-Solving-Marriage/dp/006095633X) that talks a lot more in depth about building a relationship together with less criticism and more understanding. I wish I'd found it a long time ago so I recommend it every chance I get. But if you really want a traveling job, don't give up on that. If he's steady in his career now why shouldn't you pursue it? If you have kids that can be a challenge. But still, if you can find the right arrangement you could have free reign to do as you please professionally. I hope you can find a way that works out for you and the profession you want to pursue! Hang in there. (edit: sorry for writing a book! fixed a few things.)",2019,Anger,1,0

"TL;DR at the bottom. I went through something similar to your brother, lost my dad 6 weeks before my college graduation which he told me was the only thing he wanted to live long enough to see (he was chronically ill and I was the only one of his 3 children he didn't bother going to the high school graduation for). A switch sort of flipped in me and I was angry and upset about every little thing, reasonable or unreasonable. I finally realized I needed help when I was unreasonably angry for three days over a relatively minor event and could barely sleep more than a few hours. Prior to this, people always told me I was the calmest, most patient person they ever met and I don't think I'd ever raised my voice in anger before. My usual ways of calming myself down stopped working (watching old cartoons, playing video games, and writing stories). What finally worked for me was I did something about one of the biggest problems that was bothering me (the one that was bothering me for 3 days) by finding the best nonviolent solution I could. Then I straight up refused to act on any of my anger. It was hard at first, but if I had a problem, I'd walk away from it, think about it, and try and come up with a situation that didn't involve accusing anyone of anything but did address the problem, and I accepted situations where the battle wasn't worth the trouble. Then I made sure that I was busy with things I wanted to do and that interested me but didn't include a lot of people, so I didn't have as much empty time to think about things that were anger inducing. Took me 6 months to realize I had a problem but only a week or so to fix it. I feel like anger is almost like a drug - you get addicted to the feeling of it, feel super self righteous (even if you know you are being stupid you can't imagine giving in or letting things go), and the more you let yourself do it the easier it gets to be in that state of mind and escalate the behavior to worse levels. If you always yell and scream, that will be your default reaction. So what I did was like going cold turkey, so to speak. Eventually I got myself back to the point where my default was to make a joke and laugh the situation off or make people feel like it's no big deal if they made a mistake. I think the most important thing is that your husband needs to realize and accept that he has an anger problem, and that change needs to come from within. No one can make him feel not angry except himself at the end of the day. Of course therapy might help, but he still has to actually try to do things the counselors tell him. Convincing someone they have an anger management problem is very difficult to do. It might also be worth looking into grief counseling or support groups, though, and I remember reading a study that said 40% of males with depression are undiagnosed because they express it as anger. Just don't put yourself in a position where you might be in danger, and make sure you draw lines that he knows he's not allowed to cross (e.g. swearing at you specifically, hitting you, screaming at your friends or others you care about, etc.). If he does cross a line, make sure there is a consequence for doing so (writing an apology letter, you staying at a friend's house for the night, etc.). Otherwise, in my experience, lines will be crossed far more frequently and the behavior will continue to escalate. Just keep in mind that these are things that helped me personally and there are many anger management techniques out there, some people respond to them differently. TL;DR He needs to want to change, refuse to act on his anger by yelling, screaming, and constantly reliving every bad thing that's happened that day, and think of reasonable solutions to any problems he has. Keeping busy helps. You need to make sure you draw lines about things that aren't okay from him and stick with them. Therapy could help, but only if he wants to change and realizes it's a problem.",2019,Anger,1,0
"I'm in a bit of a similar boat. 24f, mom &amp; me living with my brother and sister in law since my dad died, just graduated and trying to find a job. My brother has a bit of an anger management problem, and my sister in law is lazy to the max (usually just watches TV on full blast 24/7 while insisting we do all but wipe her butt for her). I've developed an anger problem over the past few months, which only makes my brother's explosive anger worse and he will defend his wife's laziness to the death. This is my solution: avoid them as much as possible, job hunt like crazy, just do what I need to do and stop bothering to complain because it only makes them all explode in anger. As soon as I get a job, I'm going to offer to do extended shifts to make as much money as possible, thinking about getting a second job or doing like surveys online to make extra cash, and once I have enough emergency funds saved and enough money for a deposit I'm going to get an apartment. Hopefully one at least 2-3 hours away so visiting isn't convenient or viable. Then I'm going to politely ghost them and cut our communications down to the occasional text or so. I'm not going to offer to watch their dog they couldn't be bothered to train, their baby that's on the way, or do them any other favors. Just say I'm too busy with work it join a few groups for extra excuses. It's kind of a long term plan and in the moment it's hard not to get angry, but you've got to concentrate on winning the war instead of the battle. Also getting out of the house helps - libraries are good places and you can do your hunting there while looking at resume/interview books. Also from experience, when you remove the people in your life making it intolerable, your anger tends to go away.",2019,Anger,1,0
"My dad did too and the best defense I came up with was this: -Make a joke of things. ""I swear you are plotting to kill me behind my back!"" ""Shoot, you figured it out. Let me cross off attempt number 36b. I'll try to be more subtle next time."" Kind of risky because it wouldn't work if he was angry enough. -Kill them with kindness. ""Sorry, you're right, I did do X thing wrong. I'll try not to do it again. What do you recommend?"" -Don't bring up things that will anger them, or problems in general. If you have to bring up a problem, try to word it as a solution. E.g. the roof is leaking, ""Hey dad I noticed the roof is leaking would you mind if I got some extra shingles and tried to fix it?"" -Every once in a while tell them you love them randomly, ask them how their day was, or ask them for their advice on something (even if you already have a plan, don't need and won't use their bad advice). Look a bit into their hobby so you can ask them enough questions to keep them engaged and not thinking about their anger. -Become good at lying, especially if they are the bad advice giving parent type. My dad absolutely couldn't stand if I stayed late at college for clubs or went to friend's houses, and insisted he had a copy of my schedule, so there were a lot of ""review sessions"" I went to, also rescheduled classes, test reviews, and if a class was cancelled I'd use the opportunity to go to a friend's place. Had a bunch of pre taken pictures on my phone to back up my story if it was questioned. Always would act like I didn't want to go but needed to. -Become good at changing the subject if you know it's a controversial topic. Like if my dad was talking about food and I knew it would lead into how my mom didn't put enough peas in his stew last night and he'd start yelling at her, I'd talk about how my favorite type of apple was Golden Delicious and how wouldn't it be nice if we got an apple tree? His hobby was gardening so this usually worked to get him on a gardening tangent and he'd forget whatever he was going to complain about. Have to do it subtly though, can't just be like ""Food is so important to me."" ""So I'm enjoying the weather today, how about you?"" -Finally, GTFO as soon as possible This worked for me; my 2 older siblings and my mom had screaming/shouting matches with him a lot but I usually managed to avoid all conflicts. I know it's hard but you just have to act like they are the most important person in the world and their opinions are always correct and matter the most and lie to them about the rest. Of course, you do give up a lot of freedom but for me it was worth it to avoid conflicts and deescalate those he had with my mom/others. Unfortunately your probably never going to get your dad to change of his own volition, and it's easy to say get your dad into therapy, but not so easy in practice. My dad was hospitalized for other reasons, put on meds for his psychiatric issues, and when he got out cold turkey stopped them even though the withdrawal could have killed him. He then refused to ever be given psychiatric meds again or see any sort of counsellor.",2019,Anger,1,0
"[When You Love an Angry Person](https://lynnenamka.com/anger-management/anger-management-articles/love-angry-person/) is a great tutorial for partners of people with anger. Stoicism is an under-appreciated philosophy for dealing with life's challenges. [The Art of Living](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Living-Classic-Happiness-Effectiveness/dp/0062513222/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=) is a good primer. It's not what the stereotype says, being stone-faced and unfeeling. It's about being open to our emotions and truly being able to recognize and feel them while still being able to make the best decisions we can in challenging times. The [Stoic algorithm](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/what-would-a-stoic-do-the-stoics-decision-making-algorithm/) which is basically a decision tree that helps navigate the things we can control and cannot control. This helps a lot with the small day to day things. [Getting Together and Staying Together](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Together-Staying-Solving-Marriage/dp/006095633X) is a great relationship book whether you're married or not. You could read it together chapter by chapter if you think he would do that. Even if just you read it it could still help reduce things like criticizing each other and help with better communication. You could offer to go with him to therapy and just call it couples therapy and pitch it to him as a way to help you work on your anger in your relationships. And basically talk about his brother, but you don't want him to feel ambushed. Did you seek therapy during the previous relationship to help deal with it? It’s worth it because it can help identify warning signs both with new partners and in your own behavior. It sounds like your relationships overlapped so you didn’t have any breathing room in between. It is still worth getting some kind of counseling for yourself. The problem is his anger is justified. His brother’s death is truly a tragedy. So to start him down the right path you could recommend grief counseling. He can tell the counselor everything without having to feel like he’s going to a “head shrink” if he’s against therapy. They are trained in helping people deal with the loss of a loved one. The difficult part is that he really was wronged by another person, in the worst way possible. But holding on to that for the rest of his life can destroy him. If you constantly have thoughts in your head that your life is ruined and it was “done to you” by someone else and is out of your control, eventually you’ll believe you have no control and will act poorly in making life decisions. So, counseling is a step he could take to help him work through that. A therapist generally would not state it that directly the first couple of sessions. It takes time to work through it. Maybe six or eight sessions, or three to six months depending on how it goes. If he really won’t accept help, you could try to get him to consider Stoic philosophy which was designed for dealing with life’s most difficult challenges in a level-headed way. This article puts it into the form of a [Stoic algorithm](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/what-would-a-stoic-do-the-stoics-decision-making-algorithm/) which is basically a decision tree. The goal is to figure out whether you have any control over something and if not, how to ignore it. That is the art of letting go. The great secret is simply to distract yourself from it in a healthy way to give yourself time to get some emotional distance from it so it can be viewed more rationally. He’s feeling resentment, vengeance, wanting revenge, all the bad words of [strong negative emotions](http://feelingswheel.com/). What he has to be helped to understand is it’s ok to feel them. And the goal is to work through it to the point where they fall away and he can remember his brother for the person he loved in his life. Is there a cross where his brother died? Putting up a cross might help or might make it worse. I’m not sure. But it’s something physical he could do, an action he could take and you could help him with it if you wanted. Has he visited his brother’s grave since the incident? I always think of Rocky Balboa going to visit his friend Paulie’s grave and just talking to him to keep him up on events in his life. Again, not really sure if that would make things better or worse, talking it out that way. Repetitive jobs can be a blessing and a curse. They’re easy, but they’re mind numbing. Just advise him to remember the script. What are you supposed to say when you greet and help guests? They train you to say specific things. Your job is to repeat them like a broken record. So have fun with it. But don’t let the mob get you down. You know this as well as anyone. He’s just in a bad place. If he can get out of it he’ll remember it. There’s the phrase, “Fake it till you make it.” And it’s true. If you start speaking in positive, respectful manner, you will start to feel that way. It just takes practice. The rude and obnoxious customers, you just want to “Kill them with kindness” or call security. That’s about it. &gt; Someone asks if he needs their ticket, while he is collecting everyone's tickets. head explodes Remind him every customer just needs to be trained with one or two sentences when they don’t know what to do. Sometimes it’s just by responding yes or no. But he’s training them to follow the rules. That’s also part of customer service. &gt; Someone only tips him a dollar after going above and beyond. This is endemic to the service industry, especially restaurants, etc. You know. So if money is a concern, what’s he doing to increase his pay grade? is he taking classes? Does he want to get out of customer service? What’s he doing to make that happen? But don’t take it out on cheap customers. Consider the people and the venue. You can only have your expectations so high. The right course is to lower your expectations. If someone only tips a dollar it doesn’t mean they’re a horrible person. It just means they’re as broke as we are. I know you know all this! I’m just trying to give you ammunition and talking points. When people are miserable, they say mean and hurtful things any chance they get. So all those things are just evidence that he’s raging. But if he keeps it up and someone complains he’ll be looking for a new job faster than he’s expecting. &gt; He hates that i don't take his side. He wants you to wallow in his self pity with him. But you are allowed to manage your own feelings. He has his opinion, you have yours. There’s no right or wrong, no matter the justification. He isn’t right. You’re not right. So don’t argue over who is right. Negotiate what you can agree on that works for both of you. I didn’t say that well but I think you know what I mean. The anger influences sleep and vice versa. So he wants to get solid sleep each night. If he’s all over the place that’s a problem. Getting good sleep helps reduce overall stress and anger. If you’re angry, don’t lay down, it makes it worse. Exercise helps, four times a week half an hour a day. You said he has knee trouble, so that might be part of the problem. Exercise bike, walking, etc. are just as good as anything. He won’t go therapy, what about a priest? There’s the lesson of the Book of Job that bad things happen to good people. You could go to therapy with him. You could say “we need to work on this anger” and say I will go with you and take him to couples therapy. Call your regular doctor and get a referral. They will call you back with the number and you set up the appointment. It’s usually a doctor visit copay. Out of pocket you should be abel to find someone for roughly $100 per session. So he has guilt over the state of their relationship before he died. That makes it even harder. He may feel responsible. All of this just points to a therapist. He can’t change what happened in the past. But he can change the way he views the past, his perspective on it. So he can have a more positive outlook for the future. Hope this helps a little. Hang in there! (edit: sorry if I repeated things, i have a cold and my head's a little wonky. I'm a patient of anger for 2+ years.)",2019,Anger,1,0

"Ugh I feel you! I thought I was the only one! Took me a long time to let people help. Mostly, people want to help because it makes them feel good, like they've done a nice thing. Do you like to help people? What's it feel like after you've helped someone? I try to remember that feeling and practice empathy when I find myself annoyed at people for helping. That said, I still get pissed on occasion... it's so annoying! I think I get mad because it's interfering with my belief that having someone help you means you're weak. However, in reality, asking for help is courageous. When you ask for help, you're able to admit your weaknesses and have faith or trust in someone else to carry out duties on your behalf. That sounds serious for small things such as groceries, but that still applies to your overall beliefs. A situation may come up down the road where you might need help and be reluctant to ask, like if you got sick or hurt. TL;DR: People just want to help. Asking for help is courageous, and you may need it one day more than you do now.",2019,Anger,1,0

"A lot of people don't understand that some people like to take pride in doing things for themselves even if it means doing things wrong or making it more difficult. So when people try to help, they are actually testing your personal boundaries. It's important to devise a strategy as to set boundaries while doing so in an appropriate manner. What do they care if you take three trips to carry all your groceries? Perhaps you just like things done your way. People think they are helping you, but they don't understand that they are undermining you or your confidence. I remember one time I asked one of my disabled college classmates if he needed help getting out of his vehicle and into his wheelchair. He said no and I ask him if he was sure and he said yes, and I said OK I'll see you in class. This guy obviously understood the importance of independence and to him it was just another day going to class in which he was not inconvenienced. To me I saw it has wow that must be a hassle to do everyday and he must need help. That said I just let it go and let him do his thing.",2019,Anger,1,0

"I feel that your first step should be to show this post to your girlfriend. Show her that you are, in essence, struggling with a mental block, but also that you desire to change very much. Every time you criticize her work, after you calm down, debrief, regroup with her and try to dig deep into what your feelings were. Did you feel insecure? Not good enough for her? Are you afraid she will leave you? All sorts of things can go through your mind and make you act like you do. Don't ask me how I know all this, I have the same problems.. If you cannot solve the problem right away (lets.be realistic, changing your ways completely will probably be hard work, possibly with a professional therapist) you need to at least manage this with your girlfriend and loved ones. If you apologize, even later, and explain clearly that this is not you talking, but your insecurities, and you promise to do better, people might find it endearing vs upsetting. And it shows Love, that you care, and that you want to change and improve. Powerful stuff! Good luck!",2019,Anger,1,0

"Be careful. Your desire for perfection is affecting your health and your relationships at work. You should absolutely never black out at work from frustration and exhaustion. You're killing yourself. You've drawn a line in the sand that nobody else expects you to hold. The duty, expectation, standard is what you have set on your own. Talk to your supervisors about this. ""Hey I'm killing myself every day at this job and I'm miserable. Why do so many staff here slack off? How do you as a manager package that so it makes sense to you because I hate lowering my personal standards?"" Two options: 1. Lower your expenses by trading in your car for a cheaper one, quit and get a job somewhere else that is either higher pay or a better work environment. Also check out r/povertyfinance and maybe post your situation there for advice. 2. Take the promotion and use the superior position to improve the workplace yourself by hiring better staff and introducing improvements. And the better pay will make life easier. But realize you might not be able to change the company much at all even if you rise up the ranks of management. You could consider whether a loading conveyor belt or gravity belt would help unload the trucks faster and with fewer workers. Basically trying to introduce efficiencies. You'd have to balance cost of equipment, maintenance for it when it brakes, versus cheap staff that doesn't care about anything but has two arms and can walk and carry packages. UPS's bean counters have undoubtedly run this past the insurance department a thousand times to try to decide whether to change it or not. These are enormous financial, HR and insurance decisions that have to be made at scale. They test in one warehouse to see how viable it is before trying it in more. Only then would they implement it across the country. So any adjustment like this to such a large company is like trying to get a brontosaurus to change the direction it's walking. It's a massive creature that is difficult to steer in any direction other than the one it's currently going. What if you got a job at a smaller company where your input would have more influence? You have a sharp eye for efficiency. Why not find a way to put specifically that skill to good use? You could take on some kind of QA role or inspector of some sort. &gt; Quitting means working with my dad on his home improvement jobs to make money and he's incredibly insufferable and unbearable to work with. Why? Because he has high personal standards for his work? ;) Consider for a moment how your co-workers might view you - the perfectionist. ""Mr Fancy Pants is really busting his ass. Doesn't he realize this night shift manual labor job is the bottom of the barrel? What's he trying to prove by berating us all day?"" Maybe the most important question is, can you really go to school and do this job at the same time? It doesn't sound like it because this job is so draining. If you want to go to school to so you can get a better job, working with your dad for a year or two might be the reasonable tradeoff. It's temporary after all and you will level-up to a much better position, both in pay and in environment. But why are UPS and your dad the only two job options? Try to see that as a red light. When we're really stressed out it can seem like our choices are limited. We feel like we're trapped at a fork in the road and can only go left or right. Remember to relax, ask your friends and family if they know of any good jobs that would be ideal for you. You could work your way up at a Hertz rent a car especially if you like cars and are good with directions. You could get a trucker's license. Do construction for someone else, get training to get into a desktop support role, there are a lot of things out there within just a 25 mile perimeter. They may be entry level jobs but they're not third shift which wrecks your sleep. Poor sleep wreaks havoc on your ability to manage your anger and emotions. That alone might be a good fix for you. If you're angry all the time and weren't like that before, 3rd shift could be the main problem. Protect the amount of rest you get every day like gold. And get exercise three or four times a week because that's also a huge stress reliever. Remember self-care is critical to mental resilience. But when a job really and truly sucks, you know what the standard advice is? Disengage. Literally, find ways to take it less seriously. Not by taking your frustrations out on people at work and calling them lazy. But by shutting down your high expectations of performance due to the nature of the reality of the job. Show up and just do the work but don't go above and beyond any more. I didn't invent this, it's written in job advice, article after article after article. So give yourself breathing room. Stop making things so intense. Conserve your energy for job hunting and figuring out how to improve your situation. Because the conditions at the job you currently have will never improve even if you die on your cross. Work the way you want to feel. And try not to look down on the loafers. They're just trying to manage their own sanity as well. The job itself sounds like a shit show. It's the nature of the work. Hang in there and be kind to yourself and your co-workers until you can make a change for the better. Hope this gives you some personal ammo and doesn't come across as too harsh. I'm trying to give you some pep! Protect your health. Hope you are in a better situation soon.",2019,Anger,1,0

I think it depends on where you are as to how the official process gets going. I would recommend using the search engine of your choice to get the relevant info. My experience is that there’s always a charity or two that deals with your area or country and that will have all the info you need. I will also say that there is a process that people often bypass when talking about what you need to do but I think it is important to recognise. The biggest step is to recognise that you need help. And to accept it. You have done that. And that is such a great step that it is worth mentioning. Never underestimate the power of a good friend or two that are willing to be there in the days that you can see nothing but darkness. Learn to lean on their words and let them guide you. Don’t ever look at yourself as a burden; they love you and want the best for you. Keep doing you; you’re on the right track.

Speaking about something you are pasionate about and something school makes you do are 2 comepletely deferent things also the setting is really different. My school made me have a lot of presentations and i really dont think any of them made me feel better about it even when i cared about the topic the way school made me talk in front of people didnt change anything and im still terrified of public speaking and ive done presentations on many diferent settings with pretty big audiences its still terrible but whenever im trying to have an arguement with many people at the same time i dont feel as bad even when i talk for 10 mins straight yeah repetition can make you get used to it but in the same way you can get used to any other terrible thing in life without making it any better,2020,socialanxiety,1,0
For me it was finding a hobby I loved. That hobby turned into a career. I guess I’m lucky there and that isn’t always a route. But it is SO important to make sure you have something to fill your time and give you a purpose. It’s easy to fall into a void of nothing to do and that just ends up feeding the depression. But give yourself something to sink your teeth into and you will help yourself see your value.,2020,depression,1,0

"When I (F) was in the first year of high school some guys classmates made the same comment towards me when I was ou side waiting for my parents. I guess because I didn’t pay attention to class, didn’t have friends, I just draw a lot and listened my diskman (?). I didn’t like that school and the people, they were rich and I didn’t make an effort to fit in, as soon as the day was over I left instead of staying and socializing. Anyway, they were just a bit far and they were saying shit about me and one of then coffed saying something in my language between“weirdo/creppy”. I went there and said “I’m sorry, who are you? I don’t even know your name, maybe you should mind your own business.” Never talked to them again, still don’t know their name. On the second year I made 2 friends* Eleanor roosevelt said “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” And to me this is the hard truth. And another thing: I used to let some stuff define my day. I was having an ok day until one shitty thing that lasted for 4 seconds happened and it destroyed me an the resto of the 23 hours and 56 seconds of that day. After I realized that, a lot of things changed in my life.",2020,depression,1,0

"I feel damn near bottom and I want to answer but I'm scared to say the wrong thing too... There's nothing you can do to help and they know that. They probably feel guilty if they give it a moment of thought that there's someone like you who cares, at least I do. It's really a dire place to be emotionally, they feel bad and they make others feel bad and there's no way about it. I guess understanding that would be a place to start. And then using that to... decrease the overall suffering? Like, decrease your own suffering over it, because I'd guess they don't want you to suffer or to make anyone suffer any more than they already do. It's a really hopeless place to be... hopelessness causes reckless lifestyle choices like addictions and suicide attempts and that messed up stuff. But there's probably nothing you can say to give them hope. For me the only hope I have is starting to see therapists and starting meds, like actually doing treatment-related things, although it would be beyond anything expected of you to actually get them treatment... I guess what helps is when I tell my friends/family I'm starting treatment, and then they encourage me and don't tell me to stop talking about my problems like I expect them to, even if I'm repeating myself... It's takes energy to find a therapist alone, and I guess if you really wanted to get them treatment you could give them contact information for therapists or specific numbers to hotlines instead of just like sending links to those self-help websites or something vague... I'd say be there to listen all the time, but if they're really that bad for years and years it's gonna take a toll on you and they know that and you'll feel that. Like, I want my friends to tell me to stop talking about my problems at this point if it gets too much, but do it gently and don't just tell them to stop and end it there, tell them they can come back another time and they're not turned away... sorry for the rant...",2020,depression,1,0

"It's okay. I've had two people today (neighbor, family memeber) tell me that they will be staying in tonight for New Year's and that they too feel a bit lonely... Last year was my only year going out for NYE with a group of work friends and I had a blast. I felt like I was welcomed and I felt like I was a part of something for once in my life. Every other year I had been at home, and tonight is the same. I'm 20. But it's okay. You're not alone in your feelings. Many people feel like this. And it's crazy because you think that no one else could feel this way and that everyone is having fun, but there are many lonely people in the world. But it doesn't last for forever. I'm only staying in because I'm having some family issues and it's for the best really to sleep soon, but this year has been hard, but amazing. It got better, life. And I hated hearing people tell me it gets better because it's just cliche and it makes you want to pull your teeth out. The truth is, things in life get better, and then life happens where you have some ups and downs, and you revert back to thinking it was all a lie... But, you have to appreciate the ups when they happen, and understand that everything is a risk. And risks aren't necessarily bad at all. You actually need them in order to grow. And growth is the only way that things get better. I'm not sure what brought you to this sub but if you need a change in your life, make it and do it, no matter how impossible it seems. Make it as soon as you can. You are so, so young. You have the world ahead of you and you can make so much change at this age. That is a wonderful thing. You are not alone, I promise you that. This year can be a great year for growth. If you told me a year ago today that I did all the things in this year that I did I wouldn't believe you for a second. And guess what? I did them. Good things. And yeah I got hurt, and growing as a person and adult was hard as hell and was also painful, but what blossomed was independence and opportunity, two things I'd been fighting for my entire life. It was worth it and while things aren't perfect (I've accepted they never will be), I'm alright, and I'm hopeful. And you can feel that way, too. Things will work out.

"Forgive me? Nonsense. You've done nothing wrong, my friend. If anything, forgive yourself for having human emotions, especially the kind that speaks to how much you deserve love. And of course, for this new year and every other, you DO deserve love. Eros, unfortunately, I am not. I don't know WHEN that will happen, but I do know this: loving yourself for both your strengths AND your weaknesses is a step in the right direction. It's okay to be depressed during the countdown, because that sadness is telling you how badly you want love. It's okay to miss having someone to love, because it reminds you of how wonderful it will be once it happens again. I know it's hard, but love yourself for the bittersweet nature of it all. I assure you it will all be worth it when you're counting down in the future with a very loving partner on your arm. Embrace this new year with enthusiasm. You're not alone, and you'll be okay.

"Ok doc, tell me what's wrong. Whenever I go out, and socialize in any form, like talking or enjoying a meal with friends and stuff, I get this headache which is rather not a headache but like mental fatigue. This happens after like one hour of being infront of other eyes. To describe it more precisely, it's like my head is clogged and I can't think anything, I can't reply properly to a convo that I was able to just the previous hour. Also whenever I am alone, I feel like someone is watching me and I always, ALWAYS, act vigilant because I think there's someone behind me and about to hit me, but this is when I am alone in a large space, like my apartment when no one is home or in neighborhood. When I am alone in my room and my roomies are there too, but in different rooms , I feel at home. I am actually happy and I dance sometimes to ease off the mood. Socially, people accept me, but I always push them away because I know I'll be acting like I'm dead after one hour of acting like a normal person and it gets into some peoples' nerves and others just start avoiding me or keep asking me to show up at social events and get disappointed when I reject because I really don't have any excuse or reason to tell them.",2020,mentalhealth,1,0

Various fights later and now I can’t even think about my business, can’t even think about myself and getting better. I go through periods of being super inspired and then I start to get into it and almost instantly my brain is going to those fights and now it’s just to the point that it’s just this feelings I get now and I just stop and can’t do anything and I go to sleep.

"A couple of thoughts, take 'em or leave 'em! First off, you can solve this problem. There's no quick fix but implementing an actionable, practical plan now will make you feel a whole lot better. Boy, do I have some regrets myself. I'm squandered large amounts of money in my life. Coping with regret, financial or otherwise, is something we all inevitably need to cope with. I try to focus on the fact that I cannot control or change the past, and to focus on what I can do today while planning for tomorrow. On a practical level, there are tons of online communities dedicated to mutual support and advice around personal finance. It's so helpful to be in touch with people who are also trying to work themselves out of a financial pickle - otherwise it can feel very lonely, like you're the only one with serious issues. Lately I've been interested in FIRE: Financial Independence / Retire Early. It is a theory and sub-culture that involves a specific financial planning approach, along with radical frugality to help get you to your financial goals. There's a new documentary on Amazon that tells the story of a family that tries to change their spending habits in a dramatic way. I know it's hard to spend money to get out of debt, but talking to a moderately priced financial advisor or credit counselor can be helpful, particularly if you can get a personal reference to one who is competent and trustworthy. It certainly isn't a short-cut to financial well-being, but depending on just how much in the hole you are, take a look at bankruptcy. It's a pretty extreme solution but it makes sense in some situations. I've had some really serious ups and downs financial in my life. I'm middle-aged now, and I have come to believe that as difficult as things may get, the ""universe"" will ultimately take care of me, because each time I've been on the ""brink"", something good has come along. This is kind of mystical idea, and though I believe it on some level, I also take it with a little grain of thought. The key is that it comforts me when I need it. Also on more of a mystical level, I tried to believe in my heart of hearts that underlying this reality is abundance rather than scarcity. When I've gotten to difficult place financially, I start to view the world in terms of limit resources, of scarcity. Viewing things in terms of scarcity is not helpful. It's more about mindset than magic. I hope the new year brings you abundance and acceptance of the past so you can move forward in both your mind and actions!",2020,mentalhealth,1,0

I know how hard it is to see any hope in the future, but truth is that you never know what you might find if you just endure for a bit longer. As cliché as it sounds, there's bound to be light at the end of the tunnel. I can't really advise you with the ""feeling like my friends don't like me"" thing because it's something I'm deeply struggling with too. Maybe you could try talking with them openly about this? Just know that you aren't alone with these feelings and you can always message me if you need someone to talk with.

"Sounds like a good way to start off the new year. Here's some things to keep in mind: 1. Start off taking it with meals to see if you can tolerate okay (one common side effect is nausea). It also helps you get into a dosing schedule, which is super important. Breakfast time is usually best especially when starting a new medication (so you aren't having major side effects after a dose before bed). Remember, consistency is key with dosing medications: you want to try and take it around the same time every day. 2. Be mindful of side effects. You can look them up or ask your pharmacist for a sheet. Common ones for Wellbutrin are nausea and loss of appetite. There are some more uncommon ones like headaches and dizziness. Until you have a general idea how it affects you be mindful of your activities 3. Antidepressants can cause a short term introduction or increase in suicidal ideation. It is temporary but can suck. Keep your doctor and other professionals in the loop if this occurs for you. 4. Antidepressants help take the edge off your symptoms but do not necessarily eliminate them. Pairing medication use with other interventions like therapy, exercise, healthier diet, and social interaction will maximize the impacts of the medication. It also helps you remain less reliant on it for relief. Don't forget good sleep hygiene too.",2020,mentalhealth,1,0

Giving yourself something to look forward to and enjoy can be key. On the flip side, don't force yourself to do something you really don't want to. Your gut instinct is there for a reason and helps you avoid situations which may be detrimental to your health. If you need a quiet night in and a sleep to refresh then so be it.

"Wanted? It's day 1. We have 364 more days to go. :) It's very hard to ""be less depressed"" overnight just like it's hard to ""be less angry."" No on else can fix it for us. Only we can change ourselves. And it's best done slowly. One small thing at at time. How to deal with them depends on your relationship with this person. If it's a parent, that's one thing. If it's a boss that's another. We can find another job. But with a parent, relative, even friend is more difficult. We have to work on [boundaries](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/childhood-neglect/2015/07/the-four-kinds-of-boundaries-how-to-build-them/) especially if we've never really been taught to manage them well to begin with. Myself included, I still have a lot of difficulty with it. Books like [Rage](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Step-Step-Overcoming-Explosive/dp/1572244623) or taking an [online class](https://mentalhealth.openpathcollective.org/account/anger-management/) help deal with the anger itself. But for bigger questions it helps to read things that help us figure out our perspective on life and what helps us feel connected and worthwhile. That's what therapy is for too. I'm glad you didn't do anything like that. You're not a coward. Try to look at it as a flicker of hope. A potential for connection with others. Even if it's the tiniest bit of glimmer possible, but it's there. Keep working on that. When you're feeling dark, there are subs like r/suicidewatch with good advice. But also reach out and talk to a [live voice](https://www.betterhelp.com/gethelpnow/) in real time. Remember that there are people out there that want to see you succeed. And the darkness comes from our own overly harsh judgment of ourselves. Lighten your standards of yourself for a while. We can't all be Bill Gates. Some of us are just everyday people trying to be decent human beings. But also try to remember that if we are constantly looking for that accident, in a way we are living with really negative perspective. Walking around with those thoughts as our number one go-to thoughts prevents us from seeing positive opportunities, like a chance to do work with more interesting people, a chance each day to take time for ourselves and enjoy the simple things. Happiness isn't doing cartwheels every day. Happiness is finding small reasons to feel gratitude and true contentment on a daily basis. It's ok if those things that make us happy are movies, good food, going for walks in the park. That's the core of life, stories and experiences. Hang in there.",2020,Anger,1,0

"Look. No matter how smart, hard working, or even prepared you are; you'll always find yourself in situations like these where you feel as if you're facing insurmountable odds. What you gotta do is, first, take some deep breaths and realize you aren't gonna die and aren't in danger. Yes. This is stressful, but you won't die no matter what happens. Calming down and accepting that, in the present moment, you're safe and nothing is gonna hurt you will help you calm down and be more level headed. Try meditation if you need, but keep as collected as possible. After that, just keep telling yourself ""I'm gonna do the best I can"". Because, in times like these, that is all you can do. And any effort will leave you better of than none. You cannot change the situation, only decide how to handle it Study as much as you can for the first exam For the second, you have a whole week, study a good bit every day leading up to it with good habits (20min chunks separated by 5 min breaks) and don't try to cram to much in one night. You'll at least do better than you would have.

Basically they do everything that we do but just better and they don't hate themselves every second of the day. If you want to feel like you have a normal life you gotta stay on the track to getting better. Nobody really has a normal life it's just everybody has problems and how you deal with them is what makes the day a good or bad day. Nobody's problems are bigger or smaller than yours. Problems are problems and all problems have solutions you just gotta search for it. If you want to go out, go out! if you're afraid don't let that consume you take baby steps and soon you will be able to go out alone and not be afraid.

"I'm pretty sure that everybody here that has already gone through high school has similar experiences as you. I can tell you that you shouldn't let this consume your thoughts all the time. You're only 17 and I know people who are 26 and still don't know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. Its a really big choice to make and often people switch careers when they choose to fast. You're only 17, my dude, you got lots of time to figure out what you want to do. Take classes in uni for the first year and figure out what ones you like and which ones you didn't and then look at what career you want to take from those classes. University is all about discovering the rest of you and building yourself for life without school (Also understanding how to work in your career field). Girls though that is something that is really tricky. Girlfriends are a great way to build yourself and learn to care for someone but you need boundaries especially when you're younger. Also, don't let it consume your life. Talking in a calm manner and allowing them their voice and their opinions are a great way to build a relationship further. Also if you want to be boyfriend and girlfriend or girlfriend and girlfriend you just have to talk to the person about your feelings but not coming across as needy, something along the lines of ""I really like you and I just want to know what your stance is on us"" and if she says that she really likes you then you can bring up the question of ""do you want to be boyfriend and girlfriend"". It takes a lot of confidence to say those words but you won't feel relief if you keep it bottled up. Highschool is a fucked up place but just focus on yourself and getting your high school diploma. Also, keep on searching for the things that interest you. Things just won't magically appear unless you try &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I am telling you what will happen if you let your emotions consume you and this is coming from personal experience Back when I was in high school I was super depressed and loved this one girl that was a year older than me. We dated and I let that consume my entire life, I went from 80-90% in class to 40-60% and didn't graduate (not enough credits). I let a relationship consume my life and didn't think for a second that I in my later years I would have as many troubles as I do now. People I know who had focused on their personal life and not let dating consume them have their high school sweetheart still, going to university or have already completed university and seem pretty happy about where they're at. We were all in the same boat of ""we don't know what we want to do when we get out of high school"" and just simply setting yourself up not to fall will allow you the time to figure out what you want to do. I'm 22 and I just realised that I wanted to work in the CGI movie/Game design. If I didn't do what I did in my past I would be in a much better place, but also with my current experiences I know what I should not do in the future. Trial and Error are the only ways you can learn, and that is what everybody does in life. It's often stressful but taking a step back and going at it with smaller steps and a calm mind will be better than anything else.

"Your story is so similar to mine that I had to make a profile so I can chime in. Had my fist outburst last night, also with a bartender. It was so bad that we ended up yelling curse words at each other while everyone stood there looking perplexed. I somehow didn't get thrown out and had one of my friends get drinks. I have the same issue you have and hate being (what I perceive) purposely ignored, which was most likely what initiated everything. I also have a idea what the world should be like and when it does not match, I tend to get upset. But like you mention bellow not using ""shoulds"" helps. Although I failed miserably at maintaining my cool (alcohol didn't help), I have found that this anger is coming from other places and meditating and journaling to find closure helps out a lot. Things like being ignored, disrespected, and feeling like I don't have control usually trigger my worst anger episodes. Seems like you are pretty self aware! Figure out your stressors and train yourself to catch yourself getting angry. Also I think you're totally right, going drinking is probably not good until you get a better handle on you anger. Yesterday was the first time I have gone out drinking in over 4 months, and it was only because it was NYE. Lastly, I will say that voicing your feelings was not wrong (not sure how aggressive you were), especially if you felt that you were not being treated fairly; you're paying after all.

I struggle with it every day, but I'm beginning to get glimpses of freedom. My therapist taught me to do moving meditation and tell yourself to be effortless.

You will always have phases and times in your life where you will end up feeling so confused or broken or whatever that you can’t imagine it ever stopping or ever getting better ever again... but then you get better. You always do. And that’s how you transform, that’s how you get stronger and grow. You overcome mountains because the more you do, the more beautiful life can become... the more opportunities you will have in life. Listen I know how hard it is but please please don’t stop believing. It can get better, it WILL get better. Life really is a fucking miracle and it likes to surprise you in ways you cannot imagine or wish for. So please get up and try to make the best out of that fucked up situation, be gentle with yourself because you ARE indeed TRYING, and that’s all you need to do at first. You will figure out ways. Take it one day at a time and celebrate even the tiniest of accomplishment. I believe in you even though I don’t know you, so it’s time for you to do too! ;p Please stay strong, open up, be honest about how you feel. TALK TO PEOPLE you are worth being heard.

"I'm wrestling with this myself right now because I'm in a job that is truly difficult to endure (and I've worked customer service and food industry jobs and found them more pleasant than my current job). For one, you need to make sure you have little things in your daily life that you enjoy that you can fit around work. People call this ""self care,"" and I find that to be a frustrating term sometimes, but they're right that we need to find ways to take care of ourselves and get a little bit of enjoyment every day despite work and other obligations. Second, you may need to learn to compartmentalize or find a technique to let go of your work worries. You know that dreading work that begins 4 days from now isn't actually helping you. So there needs to be some technique for you to pause those worries until you're actually headed to work. Seeing your friends and skiing has been one method for you, and that's great. You'll need to find methods that work for you during your alone time. Third, you've got to find a way to challenge or let go of the idea that today is ""ruined"" by work. We're all guilty of that thinking from time to time. Same for the mentality that vacation = great and regular life = shit.

"Yes! I am (30M) currently dealing with this issue now. I used to be the same way you described above, optimistic, extroverted and easy going. Now, I am struggling with and deep anger issue that is completely out of character and seemingly out no where. I have started journaling and meditating to see if I can figure out what is causing this, and fix it. If that fails then I'll do what you are doing and go to a counselor and talk to him or her about what is going and where I think its coming from. Meditating and journaling have really helped me start to pin point the root causes. In my case I found that the shift was not as sudden as I thought, I was slowly turning into who I am, and I am noticing now because I am having strong anger outburst. Do you know what your stressors are? What sets you off at home that makes you scream and slam doors? For example I found that my biggest outburst happen when (I perceive) someone blatantly ignores me or disrespects me. I think that those stem from a deeper feeling of me having low self esteem, because I don't feel I am were I'm supposed to be at this age. I have a really good job that pays very well, I have my own place and travel twice sometimes three times a year. But I feel sad because I am single and not married w/ children (like my friends), and that for whatever reason makes me feel like a failure. Is there something like that, that you expected to have a this point in your life that you don't have? Expectations I feel is whats kicking our generation in the butt.

"Yes--in the beginning of the decade I met my wife. We fell madly in love but her family was involved with a gang and her father actually fled another country because he was suspected of raping and murdering a few people.

I turned into a loud monster who would pop off if someone walked too close to me or did anything that I misinterpreted as putting me at a disadvantage (I ""wAsN'T aNyOnE's bItCh""). We moved to a different country to be safe and tried to start our lives but we had 5 miscarriages and then I remembered my mom sexually abused me as a kid. I cut her off and tried to get in touch with my long lost family but the only ones that were interested in a relationship were scamming grifters. Then the man who adopted me who was going to leave his business to me changed his will to leave everything to my sister when I got upset that he and his son wouldn't pay back the $20,000 dollars I lent them (would have been okay if it was just for rent/food but they were trying to fund his son's shitty comic and they had hbo and would eat out occasionally). I turned to alcohol. My anger turned to hatred. I destroyed relationships, and even started harming myself and my house. I still pop off but it's only if an old family member tries to contact me.

Of course, you’ll have a reason to start talking, but beyond that, I only have a few situational examples. If you go to school together, talk about how many more years they have until they graduate (also a good way to figure out age); if they’ve went there all 4 years or transferred; what their major is and if they like it; if they live on campus and if they like it; if they’re going to graduate school after they finish their undergraduate. If you meet them at the gym, talk about what workout they’re doing; how long they’ve been working out; ask for tips; ask what supplements they do. If you meet them at a sports bar, talk about what their favorite sports are; what teams they like; when they started watching sports; if they played any sports in school; who their favorite players are; if they’ve ever been to any games.",2020,socialanxiety,1,0

"I feel for you. This sounds like a series of awful experiences and it's understandable that you feel this way. social anxiety can be very crippling. When I was younger I worked in a fast food restaurant and I had severe panic attacks every time due to similar experiences, stress, anxiety, doing things wrong, being yelled at.. Everything! It absolutely sucks. But that was 15 years ago and all that embarrassing stuff I did doesn't matter anymore. I know it's hard to do this, but one thing that has helped me was to just start with positive self talk. You have to realise that this is a summer job, you can't expect to perform like others who worked here for longer. Don't put that kind of pressure on yourself, it only adds to the noise in your head. Sure, of course you care about what people think, and some might tell you not to care but that's easier said than done. Start with the idea that caring what others think is a positive trait, it means you want to do right by people. Tell your brother or someone who you feel comfortable with, that you want to do this job but to do it properly, you can take on one or two tasks at a time because it's easier for you to grasp it that way. This is only a suggestion of course, but I say it in an effort to make you see that being overwhelmed doesn't mean something is wrong with you, it just means you need to take a step back and take on what you can manage. When you get that negative voice in your head that tells you you're being weird and awkward, make a note of it and turn it into a conversation... Eg. ""yes I am a little awkward, but that's because I haven't done this before. When I do it next time I'll be less awkward"". I hope this helps, even a little bit.

"I get that... I don't express or show my emotions at all, and it affects me physically. When I get upset or anxious, I'll get headaches (recently found out it's status migraines) my shoulders, back and neck muscles will tense up painfully, I'll feel like I've been punched in the stomach, my legs get weak and I'll get lightheaded and sometimes pass out. Usually it's only a couple of these things lasting a couple days, but after 2 months of non stop pain, anxiety and depression kicking my butt, I went to the Dr and got myself a therapist. My Dr gave me meds to tackle the physical pain but none of it worked... It was my anxiety kicking it all off. Unfortunatly my migraines don't respond to medication, but my nerologist said it's happening more and lasting longer because my anxiety is setting it off... Which in turn is setting off my anxiety in a never ending loop. I'm in treatment now and while I still feel pain, it's manageable and keeps getting less. As a matter of fact, had an incredibly hard session today, my anxiety shot up and my stomach started killing me... My therapist walked me through some coping skills and within an hour my stomach pain went down. So yeah, I guess the thing is to treat the source... Get a physical to make sure something else isn't going on. If you're not already in therapy, getting a handle on your anxiety may help with how is affecting you physically.",2020,mentalhealth,1,0

So it could happen that someone makes fun of you for a screw up, but honestly fuck that. We all makes mistakes and there's no reason to be ashamed for such minor ones. I've found that finding humor in awkward moments helps a bit. Like when you say bye to someone and end up walking the same way. You're not the only one who's thinking ""Oh fuck this is awkward"" The other person is most likely thinking that too! It doesn't hurt to kill the awkward silence by acknowledging the awkwardness of the situation. It's possible to find immediate comfort in an awkward moment because both parties simply feel the same! Of course, doing a lap around the block in the opposite direction is always an option if you \*really\* want to avoid further interaction with that person, but then you're not tackling your weaknesses head on.",2020,socialanxiety,1,0

"I’m sure If you tune in and cultivate awareness - the type that helps you slow down and respond rather than react- you will come to predict this will happen.

Like an incoming storm tracked on Doppler, you will begin to predict that you’re escalating. Then you need practices in place to bring you down. Could be breathing exercise, meditation, a pic you keep of your daughter as a baby that you keep in your pocket that reminds You how delicate she is. It takes discipline and awareness. You got this.

"\&gt;Am I just fucked up in the head or something? &gt;Something strange and scary happens to some people. On occasion, they lose control over their bodies, their brains, and their behavior. They say and do things that they later deeply regret. &gt; &gt;“If you are a rager, you may believe you are the only person on this planet with that particular problem. Actually, you have plenty of company. In fact, author and psychiatrist John Ratey (Ratey and Johnson 1998), in reviewing the literature on rage, writes that “one in five normal, everyday people experiences violent attacks of rage that he or she cannot control”. Now this doesn’t mean that 20 percent of the population gets homicidally mad on a regular basis. But, what it does mean is that many people do become so irate, from time to time, that they say and do things they later regret. Furthermore, these _individuals often say that they don’t like losing control that way but that, when it happens, they truly cannot stop themselves.” From Rage by Ronald T. Potter-Efron. We're just strangers, so we can't say with real certainty the extent to which something is wrong with you, but I can at least say that your general situation is not unique. &gt;I just want to convince my family that I have the maturity and emotional stability of a nineteen year old and that college is actually helping me grow into a mature and responsible adult, nothing more or nothing less. Yeah you're legally an adult, but 19 year olds in general are not considered mature. What does it mean to be mature? Is it being older? Making good decisions? Is it how you live every day? Having an understanding of what motivates others? I would say its a mix of all these things. College in some ways helps with these things, but not in all. But just to focus back on anger, I would suggest reading one of these, since it will help you understand yourself better, and probably your family as well.

"People without Intermittent Explosive Disorder/ anger issues would not understand but trying to stop someone anger at the time of the burn only makes it worst, just let her talk, if she doesn’t throwing things/trying to harm someone then just let her burn , it may be scary but if you are stopping her from letting her emotions get out at the time of the burn and calming her down it sort of “builds up” and one time it will all get out and this can be a real problem for your marriage. After she got calmed by herself then start talk and say what you want, people in the middle of a burn would not think about what you are saying they will defend themselves and the fight would get worst. And show her you love her, it seams to the burner like he destroyed the relationship with the person after the burn, give her a hug and say you love her. And what I think is the most important is to ask her what she want you to do while she burn, some people would like their SO to shut up and some would like them to say their thoughts/claims.

"I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding the situation, but based on your description of the issue I'm left wondering whether or not it's actually a problem that your wife sometimes speaks passionately about certain things given that you're already the consistently cool-headed partner in the relationship. There are many decisions and assessments of situations where a calm, mindful approach is best, and some where our emotions can motivate us to notice and address problems we might have otherwise downplayed or explained away. As long as your wife isn't acting harshly toward you, you might try to mindfully give her the space to express her feelings. If you disagree with them, you might wait patiently to bring the subject up again when she seems less triggered.

"You’re able to admit your mistake here and can admit to yourself you were in the wrong. This is a big step in the right direction. If you truly want to show your family that you are mature and are capable of getting better about this, you need to also be able to admit your faults to the people you hurt. It’s the hardest part. Even though you knew what you did was wrong and can say it here, there needs to be a moment where you say “I’m sorry I fucked up, what I did was wrong and I got defensive when confronted with it instead of owning up to it”. It sounds like you might have a hard time just being able to tell someone else that they are right about something you don’t want to hear.

"Were you diagnosed bipolor or any other diagnostic reason for the Depakote and Klonopin? Medication for anger is usually a last resort. The reason being that the side effects can be worse than the reason to take them. The thing to do is address the anger directly by taking a class like this [8 Hour Course](https://anger-management-classes.net/anger-management-classes-8-hours.html), read a book like [Rage](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Step-Step-Overcoming-Explosive/dp/1572244623) as a supplement to the class and start keeping an [Anger Journal](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/anger-diary-and-triggers/). Use the same journal for [anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201404/how-keep-thought-diary-combat-anxiety) and negative self talk, often huge triggers for anger. As you're working your way through the online course, use the journal to take notes on what you notice is very related to your anger. I say ""journal"" but just grab any old notebook lying around the house or get a new one and dedicate it to writing what helps and what you're working on. Write today's date and the thing you got mad about today. When you remember past incidents write them down too. But not as a reason to beat yourself up about it. Getting mad at yourself for getting mad only makes it last longer. Treat each anger incident as an episode you can review to help figure out at what point you could intervene with yourself to have a better outcome next time. At what point could you have stopped talking, get a glass of water, stare out the window, count to 100, stretch your neck, stand up for a minute, or go for a walk? What we do depends on how agitated we've already become. Going for a walk is the thing to do if we're already really mad. But the goal it to catch it before we get super angry and are stuck in it. So we need to pay attention to how we feel several times a day, especially just before we go into an interaction with someone else. How do we feel when reading the news, etc. We can't change the news. We can only change our reaction to the news. Sometimes the best reaction is to turn it off and take care of ourselves. We can vote. That's the greatest power we have. But the other 364 days left in the year we have to focus on our own physical and mental health. Go to the gym, get good sleep, eat something cooked at home. Turn all social media off at least an hour before bed. Remember what it was like to read a book or just watch a silly movie. We did it to relax. Instead we're getting fired up online all the time. It helps to think of it as social media hygiene. Just like brushing our teeth, at some point we need to limit our intake and our outrage. If we're outraged all day, it's going to take a toll on our health. The world can be unfair, that's true. It makes us feel justified in our anger. But if we let it make us miserable then we're not able to help others. If we're ""that close"" to anger all the time, then we're not learning to cool off. We're staying in a hyped up state, ready to jump to anger any minute. It's the same problem as punching a pillow to calm down. It doesn't work and they don't teach it any more in therapy because it's at the end of the anger cycle. Instead of focusing on ways to come down we need to focus on prevention, because that's the only way we will need to come down less and less. Write down what's unfair, what you're dealing with. And find ways to know your stance without letting it tear your day apart. You don't have to write a lot. Especially while taking any anger management class, or reading a book about it write simple, straight forward notes on what sounds like it would help. And even notes on what they don't seem to cover in the course. That's our homework, the thinks the class does well we can practice applying immediately. The things the class doesn't do well, we need to dig more and do a little research on how to handle them. Hang in there.",2020,Anger,1,0

"First, it's important that we own our anger rather than blame it on others. If we don't take responsibility for how we express our anger, we'll never get better at controlling it. That said, some people in our lives frequently trigger us, and we should be patient and understanding with ourselves if we struggle to communicate with them sometimes. In your case, it sounds like your boyfriend is dismissive of your feelings. That suggests emotional immaturity on his part.

But then there are the times we go overboard and expect our partner to get just as angry as we do, basically demanding they experience the same intensity of anger. That is too much for them to bear.

"I have a very similar history and anger triggers. Things that have helped me not get effected by triggers is regularly dosing quality cbd edibles and grappling arts. I train mma but when I am in a shit mood grappling live specifically makes me way more chill. Punching things can usually feel somewhat relieving but can also ""feed the monster"" (if you do want to get a punching bag however, a double ended bag can actually have a nice tranquilizing effect because of the focus on technique and timing instead).

"I can relate to how you feel about this matter. Even I have the same sickening problem. I find it so frustrating when it comes to saying my own name and due to this I tend to avoid almost every situation that requires me to introduce myself. It's ruining my life. Even if I could talk without stuttering at least without the other person detecting it, I have a terrible time with my name thing and a couple more issues like answering the phone or placing orders or facing interviews. It's so emotionally crippling and physically tiring. I just feel that I had an easier name so that I could just go about my day-to-day activities without having the need to panic and experience anxiety. I also be like it's my name and I want to be able to say it and I hate the feeling I get when someone asks for my name. It's not easy for me. My mind gets so terrified and it practically kills me. I wish I could be like others in this matter alone. So if someone asks me what's your name or your name please I could easily say it without beginning to feel like I'm being questioned by some officers. Hope you'll be ok mate!

"&gt; It is quite interesting how anger comes to connect people on an emotional/spiritual level. It is a kind of connection where there is no need to identify the causes or the reasons behind the emotion itself. It is very strong and powerful -yet extremely dangerous- energy that can be felt just by the mere sight among people with such emotion. &gt; &gt; Although it might only take a second to be identified among people with such strong anger within them, but it creates a deep connection of special kind. This connection might be confused or clouded by other emotions (as per each individual) and interpreted as romantic, sexual, or even hatred, and in many cases all together. This kind of emotional connection is based empathy, this empathy isn’t felt due to weakness, rather the un-explainable pain and suffer to overcome awfulness and weakness, creating an empowering sense of compassion without the need for any explanation or much information except for the second we look through each others eyes, it turns into an instinct that works behind our conscious and extends its way to our gut. &gt; &gt; It’s a gut feeling, not clearly identified and confusing, feels like the saying ‘feeling butterflies’, in this case a better metaphor would be ‘bees’. It gives a person the ‘buzz’ that pushes them into motion, to strive, push forward, and work hard to overcome these experiences. But just like bees, working hard and synchronising with nature in a beautiful mesmerising way as we watch it from a far, we get curious and might take a step forward to watch closer and admiring the beauty of its work, we make the mistake of coming too close, too close the bee might feel taunted, and for the sake of the other bees, this one becomes selfless and defensive to a point where the bee attacks with as much power as it has, and it stings. A sting so powerful that leads the bee to self-destruction, for many it might seem heroic, but the bee takes no pride, it knows to its guts that it is a duty and a responsibility that this is simply a reaction that requires less than a split of second of thinking, and the reaper becomes the bee’s companion for eternity. &gt; &gt; -Aly Hamdy",2020,Anger,1,0

"It's easy to feel condemned to anger because of not only our individual, personal past but our family's past, father, grandfather, etc. But don't let yourself think you can't change. You may feel like you're at your lowest but there is always lower. Don't worry about that. Just stop beating yourself up about it and be especially kind to yourself and everyone important to you while you are figuring it out. I hope [this advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/c973g8/anger_when_depressed/etb8jrn/) is relevant to your situation. You could take an [online anger management class](https://anger-management-classes.net/anger-management-classes-8-hours.html) and finish it in about a week. It's harder to get through a book but there are a lot out there to choose from that are good and concise like [Rage](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Step-Step-Overcoming-Explosive/dp/1572244623) if you are really quick to anger. The question is what exactly do you get mad about? That's something to have really open talks about with the therapist. But remember you don't have to do a deep Freudian analysis or rehash your entire life to make immediate improvements. The class and book can help you figure out how, right now, to do better in the moment. Don't beat yourself up about it. Treat it as a learning project. The techniques you've used to manage anger were taught to you by your paternal lineage. But they're not working any more. They were never really working well before anyway. So now is an opportunity to put those bad techniques down and pick up some new ones that work a lot better. Keep your sessions goal oriented. Grab a notebook and use it as a journal to write notes during the sessions. But remember the real work happens between visits, when you're on your own trying to figure out how to apply the advice they give you. So write notes when things don't go well or you don't know what to do. And bring it back with you so you have concrete examples to talk about. Keep a to do list of the most important things you're trying to improve. It's ok to come back with failure. If you're ever going to share that ""this week didn't go so well"" the therapist is the person to share that with. Hang in there.",2020,Anger,1,0
"Know your limits. If you're starting to get agitated separate yourself from the people who are making you mad or even just frustrated. You have the right to maintain your own inner environment. If you feel your inner weather becoming too turbulent, take a break from them and give yourself time to cool off. It's good to use a healthy distraction like exercising, reading a book or watching a movie. Stay in touch regularly with your doctor. Let them know how you are doing right now. Switching meds is hard. So give yourself extra time to do certain things. Don't schedule anything for three or four days when you are starting a new med because we never know what the ramp up on them will be like. They can wipe us out for a couple days straight sometimes. Go easy on yourself during this time. With the hallucinations the important thing is to not worry about them. Don't be afraid of them at all. There's nothing wrong with you. Don't fear them or blame yourself for them. Don't beat yourself up for having them. Try to have a good relationship with them. Like a friend who may just tend to show up at awkward times. They don't mean you any harm. They are a fleeting experience. Don't go digging around in your head or body to try to find where they come from. Treat your body and mind as one whole, integrated unit. There is nothing to separate out or figure out about it. Turn on a light, lock the door or count to 100 if it makes you feel better. At night if you have them and get upset, remind yourself that you're safe and comfortable. Rub your hands on your upper arms lightly, focus on the feeling of your hands against your skin. Also, feel your weight on the couch, chair or mattress as a way of grounding and feeling present in the moment. Just do what you can to improve the rest you get. If you have trouble relaxing at night there's the simple but effective [progressive muscle relaxation](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/progressive-muscle-relaxation-pmr/). And during the day such as after work you might try [Savasana](https://www.griffinshill.com.au/blog/savasana-a-much-misunderstood-yoga-pose) (shavasana) which is a simple yoga pose for relaxation. If you have any insomnia, work on getting better rest. Before going to bed it helps to just write down any thoughts, worries, to-do items that are keeping your mind spinning. You can use it as a list of things to review the next day if you need to. But it gets those things out of our head so we don't have them constantly keeping us awake. Remind yourself that you don't have to maintain vigilance to keep those things in your head all at once. You're allowed to get good sleep. Everyone faces the next day better if they are well rested. It helps to [have a guide](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201404/how-keep-thought-diary-combat-anxiety) to work through the persistent ones. Reading a light book is better than looking at a phone before bed. Hope this helps. Hang in there.",2020,Anger,1,0

Frustration is when you want to get from point A to point B but something small gets in the way. if it was only one thing, then no big deal but if its 2-3 small things back to back then you explode. Thats frustration. This manifests for me in social relationships. if my wife or friend says something out of context that I cant understand I instantly get frustrated and annoyed. If they continue to explain without context I get upset. Here is the sense I have made from it. I have come to realize that I view the world as a machine that must run smoothly, logically and reasonably in a highly efficient manner. If something is not doing that, then its broken and must be fixed or must be ridden of. So its not my fault I am angry, its the people and systems that are the problem. You see how that works? Its others that slow and not operating at peak efficiency and in what I consider rational manner. The solution for me was to realize that I dont have to understand. if my wife says something that makes no objective sense but makes subjective sense to her, then that is good enough. You dont have to understand everything. The things that you do have to understand for say work, just accept the emotions. Neither indulge the emotion nor reject. Just say, I am upset because I wish this was going faster and I could understand. Yup.. confusing things are frustrating.

Ask yourself the following questions to help determine if seething rages are or could become a problem for you. Are you unable to quit thinking about past insults or injuries? Does your anger about some past insult sometimes seem to grow greater over time, instead of leveling off or diminishing? Do you sometimes have intense fantasies of revenge against people who have harmed you? Do you hate people for what they have done to you? Would people be amazed if they knew how angry you get, even though you don’t show it? Do you feel outraged about what people try to get away with? Do you have difficulty forgiving people? Do you “seethe” in anger but don’t say anything to others? Do you deliberately hurt people (physically or verbally) in order to pay them back for something they did to you? Do you believe that any particular person (or group, organization, or institution) is to blame for your unhappiness? Do people tell you it’s time to move on and quit dwelling on the past? “If you see yourself as a seething rager, the rest of this chapter is designed to help you. There are six main steps you can take to prevent seething rages from taking over your life.” “STEP 1. Realize you always have a choice.” “STEP 2. Consciously choose to move toward peace of mind, rather than discontent, to prevent rages from developing.” “STEP 3. Examine your current thoughts and behaviors to determine if you are developing or hanging onto any long-term resentment that could produce a seething rage.” “STEP 4.

"You're friend is right and I think you should try to be open minded and see it from their perspective. You are in control of yourself always no matter what you feel. You have to be accountable for your actions. I've been where you were and I get it. I used to feel the same way. One day I realized that every action you make is a result of a decision you make. You decide to be aggressive instead of choosing to be kind and understanding. You decide to shut your friend down instead of seeing it from his perspective. You chose to apologize instead of hold on to the anger and that is a small victory. It's not easy but if you keep trying to recognize these decisions you will start making the choice to apologize, be open minded and understanding earlier in your decision making. you have to accept that you can make mistakes and that it is ok and kind of a good thing but at the same time you need to learn from them. It might take a millisecond to make that decision and you might not realize it but it is there. You're not a bad person and your friend is not attacking you. Instead of choosing to be argumentative in this instance I would challenge you to choose to love and admit your mistakes.

Through therapy i have realized I have been holding back my anger and suppressing it basically my whole life and reflecting on those moments where i snapped at people now, i think it may have been because of that pent-up and unrecognized anger. Depending on your life and situation, maybe consider therapy or self reflection on this; Are you or could you possibly be angry at something or people in your life? For me i was always snapping at my family, usually my mom and sister and now I’ve realized that i’ve been angry at them for years for some unresolved childhood things (like not spending enough time with me, not like she didnt buy me this). Perhaps sometning like this resonates with you. I’m sorry youve had this problem, friend. I would also recommend meditation if you want",2020,Anger,1,0
"I feel like he's right in that snapping is a choice, but I can see where you're coming from in rejecting that. It certainly doesn't feel like a choice when you're triggered into emotions, because that part isn't; we don't choose to feel what we initially feel during an experience. The part that we can control is how we behave after that flip has been switched. A huge step in this is recognizing when that has happened and taking a few seconds to pause and breathe goes a surprisingly long way. Disclaimer: I'm just a person on the internet. Maybe my perspective here is valuable, or maybe it's not. Take it with a grain of sand. But.... Personally, I don't feel as though what you did here was egregiously across the line. Sounds like stuff that happens between friends, and you were caught in the crossfire of their bullshit. That, to me, sounds like bullshit, and you kind of have every right to assert and stand up for yourself. It was rude of him to hit you, and while two wrongs don't make a right, he's not entitled to *your* respect and best behavior when he just carelessly disrespected you (more on this down below). Sounds to me like he's trying to deflect and redirect attention away from his own actions. He should be the one apologizing to you for hitting you, not you apologizing to him for how you reacted after he hit you for no reason, right? I don't want to make this sound overly dramatic, but this is what abusers do: flip the victim and abuser. Part of the apology in this scenario is recognizing the legitimacy of your response. Focusing on your actions in a negative way shows that he doesn't *really* care that it was his actions that pissed you off. That's a problem, and until he can recognize your emotion as legitimate, he's not truly sorry (as he sees the whole scenario as a 'you' problem, not connected to his actions). You clearly want to come to terms with this for your own good (as you should). He may not be entitled to your best behavior, but *you are,* so I can see why you want to sort this out. But keep in mind that there are times when it's perfectly okay to be angry, and to show anger. One of those is certainly when someone strikes you, even in jest, or unintentionally. That's a trigger for 99% of people's anger. Totally normal. Don't internalize some sense of wrongness or lack of control because someone else is trying to avoid the fact of reality that they hit you. Feeling as though your friends can just hit you for no reason, and you should have to sit there and take it, is far more of a hurtful situation than saying 'don't talk to me'.

I don't know. I'm not in your marriage. With my spouse and I, I would often get really mad when things weren't working out the way I wanted and accuse them of ""Not supporting me"", which was my poorly-worded way of saying ""I need more love/support"". They heard a constant jab at them not doing enough, no matter how much they tried. Over time, the pain from hearing that phrase grew worse for them, because previous fights would hinge on that, such that even though I didn't mean it in a mean way, it was extremely painful for them to hear. I had to learn to be more specific with what I needed. We both had to learn not to try to look for solutions while we were upset. Whenever one of us gets agitated, the other needs to be respectful and give space. We came up with several ways to indicate to the other that we weren't upset, but weren't going to perpetuate the fighting. &gt; I fucked up, I know I did. At any given moment, you and your husband are both doing your best. You may not be doing it in quite the right way because there are skills in your life that you are missing. There may also be issues with emotional boundaries. I don't know. But if you're there, and you're trying, then what's missing isn't effort, but skill. What skills do you need to end the fighting? Sometimes it goes much further than this single incident, and may involve improving how you communicate, better understanding your own emotional level, avoiding insults or cheap-shots, and getting away from a ""win"" mentality. If you are on the same team, then you should work on better understanding each other. Blaming yourself won't fix the problem, and worrying about who's really at fault won't fix the problem.

"Because you ultimately can't control him. We can only control ourselves. So focus on controlling your reaction instead of controlling him. When we get super mad, we pretty much become another person. So what you want to do is step away when you feel anything like that coming on. Time to take a walk. When he starts to make you mad, not after you're already super fired up. Separate yourself from him and take a trip around the block. The walking works off the energy that comes with anger and the time it takes lets you cool off. If you can't get it out of your head, [write down what bothered you](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/anger-diary-and-triggers/) about the situation. What exactly about it mad you mad? Getting it on paper helps to process it in a more cognitive, thinking way than a gut level emotional way. You can use it after you cool of, or the next day as a to-do list if you need to, to research what you are working on with him or just with your own anger management. For the next couple weeks just work on dialing your response back. Try to observe more and be less involved as a power player. Defer to your wife if she typically handles him a lot better. Have a sit-down to talk this strategy through with her. She needs to be on board too. Gradually you can come back in as co-disciplinarian as you are more comfortable doing it without getting angry. Not being a father I can't even imagine how difficult it is on top of having kids in general to also have a child with Asperger's. If you don't have a social worker, therapist or other professional involved in his care you can immediately call or talk to, line one up. Call around tomorrow and get a number you can use when things are challenging. You need someone in your corner you can talk to for advice dealing with day to day challenges you can check in with on occasion. This is definitely a challenge. Not to be too harsh to you because you are asking for help, but it can fall in the range of abuse, holding him down, etc., when he wasn't doing anything physical. The good thing is you recognize the behavior was wrong and you want to fix it. The challenge is he is going to do it again, so obviously you need a plan. Your gut reaction was to try to physically force him to comply and obviously that didn't go well. When he defies you next time and says no, what are you going to do? It depends on the specific situation. How important is it that he follow the specific rule that is being broken? You need different response levels for different offenses. Using the tablet longer than the time allotted is pretty low level. It's on par with not cleaning or putting away his toys or games, etc. A high level would be if he was hitting someone and you needed him to stop. So you want to differentiate at least two levels. Your reaction was over the top but it's possible his behavior surprised you and that's why you launched in to fight or flight mode, in this case obviously fight. We can't predict everything that will make us angry. So we just have to figure out how to deal with it when it becomes obvious there's a problem. That's what you're doing right now. So just know that it's not the end of the world. You just need a few more tools than you have at the moment. There are books like [When Anger Hurts Your Kids](https://www.amazon.com/When-Anger-Hurts-Your-Kids/dp/1572240458) (terrible title, great content).

"If I may just drop a quote from good old Mr. Aurelius here which resonates with me and might help out: ""When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly.

But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

When I 'lose my shit' over specific triggers it's like I just black the fuck out. The meltdowns usually last at least an hour so I'll remember very small snippets but when people tell me the shit I did and said it's like they're talking about a completely different human being. It's fucking terrifying. I am on medication which has decreased the frequency of meltdowns but not the severity. I don't have any advice as I need some myself but just know that you're not alone. I used to like that everyone was scared of me but as an adult I realize how lonely and sad it actually is.,2020,Anger,1,0

"Expectations are not aligned with reality. We adapt to specific responses in situations, and when emotionally charged, any deviation from what we expect can be viewed as a threat. Chances are, you were becoming emotionally charged before he tried to reclaim his tablet. You took it away because he wasn't doing what you expected, and then he followed you (you knew he was there even if you didn't consciously acknowledge it) which would feel aggressive, even if it wasn't. Consider the entire situation as a whole, but don't overextend your definition of the situation. If the interaction started with you telling/asking them to do something, did you fully engage with them? Likely not. If we have expectations, then we often don't fully engage in regards to others relating to those expectations. We invest emotionally, but not always intellectually. So, you expected him to be doing something else, but why did you expect it? Final advice: You have no control over others, only yourself and that imperfectly. Don't forget to breathe.",2020,Anger,1,0

Suppressing means not dealing with it. It's still there but it's been pushed away or ignored. Managing means applying techniques to help alleviate the intensity of each anger episode as well as learning ways to prevent it from building up to begin with.

Man I can’t say much cause I’m learning to control mine as well. I’m just gonna say what people have told me. Get therapy which I have. Idk if it helps people say it do but idk if it’s that. Try and be more positive cause the more depressed or bad you feel more angry you feel. Ofc being positive is really hard especially on a bad day and when you feel like you have no control over yourself. But just generally being more positive does help. I’m not a positive person at all but when I’m being positive I realize there’s a whole change in my mood. Ofc it doesn’t always work but worth a try. And most people said try writing stuff down. Idk you so idk or if you like writing Ik I hated it. I have ADHD and I have trouble focusing when I’m writing or doing anything really. But I honestly found writing my feelings has helped a lot tho. Even just in notes. Idk if this is gonna help but I hope it does. Lmk if you ever need to talk.,2020,Anger,1,0
I feel I'm not going to do the justice explaining it this simply but I thought I'd share this quickly anyway since it might provide some clarity Suppressing would be more of numbing yourself and not feeling the emotion by shifting your attention/awareness without processing it Managing would be being mindful of it which allows you to create some space and have not necessarily a control but an ability to co-exist with it and then you feel the anger by letting it be in your body and then you see it pass and let it go. There are ways/ practices/exercises to manage each step,2020,Anger,1,0

"You bring up a classic example of what can cause anger. The phone's being slow or you can't get it to make a call. Frustration is a huge source of anger. It can help to lower our expectations. To let things be imperfect. It's supposed to work, it should work. But the reality is that it's not. For whatever reason. Technical gadgets like phones and computers can have flaws or just not work perfectly every time. It's possibly it's not just your phone but your local network slowness or lag. It could be one of a hundred things. So by lowering our expectations of what should happen or how things should go we can introduce some breathing room. Things will not work perfectly every time and that's ok. ""It is what it is."" When it works it's great. When it doesn't work we just need more time. Wait a few minutes for the network to clear. Or restart the phone to clear any RAM that got locked up (I don't know what I'm talking about but you know what I mean :). Try to have a sense of humor. There's the show IT Crowd. Imagine calling customer support and they say, ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?"" If we can see it as a game, we can usually keep it less personal. But if we can't find humor in it or see it as a silly challenge, we take it personally and start criticizing ourselves. We can be our own worst, harshest critic. If we are laying into self criticism like, ""Why does this never work, why am I so stupid I can't figure it out, why can't I afford stuff that works, why do companies have to make such crap technology"" we are beating ourselves up for things we can't control. This is just negative self talk and with a little practice we can try to catch it and say ok this is a technical problem. It's not my fault. I just want to figure out how to make it work. Take it one step at at time. The demand for immediacy of our needs can be really incendiary. We want it to work ""right now!"" and when it doesn't we get really mad. So see if you can introduce more time into the things you want to accomplish. If the phone just isn't going to work exactly when we need it to, but it's actually performing exactly as it always does (shoddy, hit or miss, latency, bad reception, whatever it is), try to practice adding 10 minutes to accomplish the same task. This is the kind of inner dialogue we can practice having: ""Ok I need to make a call and I have a bunch of other things I need to get done. But If I pressure myself about this call, it's going to get me worked up and I may get so mad about it that I will have trouble focusing on the other things I need to do. So I'm going to let this call take 10 minutes to connect and work. That way I can slow things down and see if I can get it done. If it still doesn't go through, I will do the other tasks on my list and come back to it in half an hour."" This kind of planning out the next half hour or hour has helped me manage not only my to-do list but also myself. I know I can get frustrated but if I build a little extra time into the tasks that can be frustrating it helps me maintain a better perspective on it and I find I can actually handle things a lot better. The same with driving. I know driving can make me mad really fast. So if the journey itself takes 15 minutes, I add 20 minutes so I end up getting there a little early. 20 minutes sounds like a crazy long time to add. But it lets me not feel like I'm in a rush. I know i'm going to be there on time easily. And if something does happen that makes me mad I have time to cool off and come down from it so I'm not carrying road rage type anger into the building with me. I try to leave it all outside. Also, the way we talk in our head affects our own mood. We have a large degree of control over the internal weather in our minds. If we are ranting or using language like ""this piece of crap phone never connects to the crappy network"" we can clearly identify that the weather in our head is turbulent and negative. When we can recognize that, don't be hard on yourself. Treat this as a win. It's an extremely good thing to identify this is happening because you've become aware of it and can do something about it. Try to switch to using language that explicitly describes the situation. What exactly is happening. You're a technical person, these are technical problems. Especially the order things happen in can be illuminating. ""I'm trying to make a call. The phone appears to be on and working. But clicking call doesn't result in the number dialing. Is it connected to the cell network?"" And go through the steps, A, B, C to troubleshoot what's happening to see if you can figure out why it's not working. You can also use it as a way to practice customer service. If you worked in a call center and a customer called with the exact same problem, how would you talk them through it? We can find ways to improve our language if we role play like we are talking to a customer on the other end of the line or if our best friend was in the room and we're talking to them about their problem. We would never talk to them harshly or break their phone. So use this as a way to get practice using better language to manage the situation in a more problem / solution approach. Going for a walk really does wonders. If you've already gotten mad, there's nothing to do but put everything down and go for a walk. No phone, no music, hands free. Look at the buildings and scenery. Don't beat yourself up about it. Getting mad at yourself for getting mad only makes it last longer. So go easy on yourself while you're figuring out what works for you. Hope some of this helps.

The Anger Trap,2020,Anger,0,1
"For the anger specifically a [worksheet](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/PTSDThoughtRecordSheet.pdf) (pdf link) can help identify triggers and come up with practical things to do when we are able to recognize a pattern. I personally used this one for several months to help deal with my anger. I am not diagnosed with ptsd. (I've been told mild c-ptsd but that's nothing like what you've experienced.) I like this sheet because the explanation for each step is really good and it all applies to anger. Using a notebook as an [anger journal](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-use-journaling-to-cope-with-ptsd-2797594) or a [thought diary](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201404/how-keep-thought-diary-combat-anxiety) for anxiety is basically the same thing. The approach is very similar. I like the journal because I can write as much or as little as I want for each section. So sometimes I take the worksheet out and use it as a guide but I date the top of a new page and write it in the notebook. That way I can find it again more easily if I want to review it again to see if I feel like I need to review again what the trigger was. This helps a lot when something similar happened but for some reason it still caught me off guard. We can't predict or anticipate everything that will make us angry. So we need to be patient and especially kind to ourselves while we're working on it. Don't get mad at yourself for getting mad because that only makes it last longer. Any kind of regular exercise we can get helps. When you can't do anything else just going for a walk can do a lot of good. No music or phone, hands free. It's the exercise that helps burn off some of the cabin fever, agitation and the endorphins just make us feel better. Don't treat is as, ""I have to do this because of my anger."" Just do it because we're meant to move. So anything exercise related is good. And sleep/insomnia should be addressed directly too. Lack of sleep automatically leaves us irritable and much more easily frustrated with day to day things. Before bed, writing down persistent thoughts that won't go away helps free up space in the mind to relax and get some rest. You don't have to feel like you need to be vigilant and hold and keep track all of it mentally. It will still be there on paper in the morning if you need to review it again. Keep it by the bedside in case you need to write more things down to help with sleep. But the worksheet treats each time we get angry as an episode or an incident we can investigate to try to identify what happened that made us mad. For me it's most often my own thoughts. But it can be things people say, something on TV or in the news, certain social situations, that bring out a particular reaction. I found that if I can't see it coming I can't prevent my reaction. So half the work is recognizing the things that repeatedly make us angry. Print ten copies of it off and have it ready for the next time you get angry. If you can remember a recent incident you can use it right now. You don't have to write a lot, just enough to remember the situation, who was involved, what your thoughts were about it. The order things happen in can be really helpful. I also know for me, if I try to hold things in to prevent getting in an argument, it can make things worse. I need to talk things out and work through it to feel acknowledged and validate my feelings. To do that I have to purge the automatic response to push it down or ignore it thinking it will just go away with time. It never does. So if I know I can't talk about it with someone I do a worksheet or grab a notebook and just write it out a little bit to dig into it. I feel like this method of worksheet / journaling gives me some power back over my own thoughts and emotions. My feelings are my own and they're legitimate because they're mine. I don't have to apologize for having them because they're real. But I do need to work through them somehow so my feelings don't eat me up and make me miserable, not just to be around, but by myself too. They say a true test of happiness is whether you can stand being in a room alone by yourself. That's still a struggle but a few techniques like this helps. Hang in there.",2020,Anger,1,0

"I'm much of the same, short term solution is to stop drinking or control it in such a way that you are not a danger to others. So have a couple drinks to relax when you're alone watching a movie.

Drink with people who don't make you angry. Don't drink when you're in a bad mood. Also realize that your mood may never be appropriate to add drink into, at least not now. I never used to be an angry drunk. Only person I get angry drunk at seems to be my boyfriend although I can't be certain anymore, so far I'm happy and chatty with everyone else.

"It's ok to not feel good about stuff people do online. Hit pause or whatever you need to do and get out of it. You can reduce your anger. Online gaming, just like online forums can be much more toxic than real life. They wouldn't say or do the things they do standing for real in front of other human beings. So choose your level of involvement. As soon as you notice it's a toxic bunch, back out. When someone starts spouting garbage, the second you start to feel personally affronted, irritated, even mildly offended because it's not funny any more, the number one thing is to try to remember to back out. Just stop playing. That's the hardest part. But once you get in the habit of listening to how you feel, and you notice when someone is being an a-hole, just back out. Pull the eject cord and get out of the game. Give it an hour or however long it takes to come back down. You can use whatever tools exist in the system to report other users for their toxic behavior. It helps to familiarize ourselves with the policing tools whatever platform tools there are for reporting bad behavior. But the most important thing is to manage your amount of interaction with them. Don't even give them the satisfaction of being in the room with them any more. And sometimes that's their goal, to route a group with their obnoxiousness. But nothing good comes of trying to put up with them. Just bail and leave them to their own obviously miserable lives. They wouldn't pick on other people if they were living a happy life. So block them and forget them. Stop playing while it's still fun. Never mind waiting until your character dies. When you start to feel frustrated or agitated, just at that very first inclination, and it's no longer curious and entertaining, go ahead and pause and withdraw from the game. Give yourself ten minutes to cool off. Then start again. This is a way to recondition how you approach the game. If you find you get caught up in negative verbal back and forth easily, work on cutting down your conversation to just tactical communications related to game play. No putting people down or laughing at other's expense. It can be a good rule of still having something to say but not participating in the negativity. If someone shouts ""you suck"" at you, completely disregard it. If you did something that resulted in their not doing well, apologize sincerely. But don't get tangled up in mud slinging. When they go low, we go high. Mute people. Block them. Withdraw from toxic teams and discords. Don't allow yourself to think you need to ""toughen up"" to play with the big boys. The people who are genuinely good players are usually good people too. They don't need extra bravado to prove themselves. It can feel like it spills over into real life because it's so immersive. It's immediate and visceral. So put an hour between game play and interacting with real human beings. Stop an hour before dinner or hanging out with friends. Be aware that if you're in your room screaming, the rest of the house is feeling it too. Wear a headset if you don't already so they don't have to hear the chaos through speakers. And avoid screaming during play as much as you can. This can help lower the tone at your house for everyone else. And just being aware of it can lower it for you too. It keeps the game online and not in your bricks and mortar residence. Trying to come down from it at night it helps to stop gaming an hour before bedtime. I know that can also be hard. For sleep it also helps to write down what happened and your thoughts about it. That way they're on paper and you don't have to hold them in your head. Really persistent thoughts, just write them down and you can deal with them tomorrow as a to-do list. But you allow yourself the luxury to go to sleep and get some rest. Hope this helps.

You aren't the only one. I have anger and rage built up in me since I was a child and as an adult it got worse.... I have terrible road rage when people cut me off and break in front me I lay my hand on my horn and cuss them out and roll down my window and scream at them. I sometimes want to pull over and get out of my truck and fight them also. I am also looking for help as I can't afford therapy for help or meds. For now I just watch YouTube on intermittent explosive disorder and anger. Helps alittle but I know at the moment when something sets us off our body's go into that ticking time bomb mode and we implode because it feels good to get it out. There's been times where I'm upset and angry about something else and I scream and cry in my truck and I feel like a freaking lunatic. I am new to reddit and so far by reading other people's stories and commenting give me a little hope and that I am not alone. If you are ever feeling angry at something and want to talk feel free to message me and try some youtube videos. I know it's not the same as a real therapist but it's free.,2020,Anger,1,0
I was mentally abused by my mother when I was little. She would get so angry at everything and she would yell and scream at me all the time and say horrible things to me. Now as I am older she tries to be a better mother...but now I feel so messed and and damaged in the head. Everytime I get angry and yell I think m of her...it sucks.,2020,Anger,0,1
"Hi OP, I hope you're doing alright now. It's very insightful of you to know the triggers and that'll be helpful when working on issues like this. You did so well by trying to avoid the confrontation! That there is proof you're not a bad person. You can't control the other person, and what they did was wrong, uncalled for, and utterly rude. I'm happy to hear that it didn't end in violence; it could very quickly turn into a stabbing or shooting...and it's not worth it. Even if you don't harm them or get into a fight, they can still claim harassment (I'm not sure where you are, but that's a risk in my country). I've always found that a few, deep hard breaths, gripping the steering wheel, and thinking, ""This \[insert favorite curse here\] isn't worth it. Isn't even worth the beat down!"" Or something along those lines. Hell, if it's really bad (your anger, I mean), find a safe spot and pull over. Scream if you need to. But please don't drive when anger has consumed you. It's not safe and someone completely innocent to the situation could get hurt or killed (including you). But no, you're not a bad person. You dealt with this situation in the best way you could, even if you did confront him. You had the insight to know not to fight and you seem like you're working on you. Also, on an unrelated note, I like that term ""mean mugged"". Where's it from if you don't mind me asking?",2020,Anger,1,0

You won't let it go because you feel like you let yourself down and thats a good thing because you can learn from what happened to you.

"It's well known that stress and anxiety can cause skin conditions such as dermatitis and [eczema](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-emotional-wellness/). Anger manifests differently for each of us. Some get headaches, blurred vision, chest discomfort, abdominal distress, etc. Some never notice it until they realize their standing there with their fists balled up. It completely depends on the person. But we may find we react very similar to our parents and those we were raised by. We might make observations like, ""I'm just like my mom"" or ""I'm completely the opposite of my dad"" when noticing their reactions to anger. Having that knowledge is actually helpful because we can start to see the story supporting our anger whether it's genetic predisposition or completely learned behavior. If you can lower your overall frustration and tension levels it should help reduce the blemishes and the anger flareups at the same time. But definitely go ahead and see your doctor again if you can't control the blemishes, especially if they are uncomfortable. You shouldn't blame yourself and allow yourself to be in unnecessary pain. Don't beat yourself up for the blemishes. And don't get mad at yourself for getting mad. That only makes the anger last longer. Knowing what you argue about can help us give more specific advice tailored to your situation. But I hope [this advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/civ1fu/i_just_see_red_sometimes/evmu7ak/) is helpful. When we don't know what else to do we can easily fall into the same old behavior. When we're angry all the time the angry feeling is like a magnet and we get sucked right into it. You are right, the lizard brain does take over and we lose all sense of being rational. It helps to have a plan for when you get angry next time. What are you going to do. I hope [this advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/c62672/im_afraid_of_hurting_my_loved_one/) is help for that. Sorry for directing you to other pages but I hope it's useful and applicable.

There are also [coping skills](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/coping-with-depression.htm) such as regular physical exercise that work at least as well as medication for many sufferers. I wish you all the best during this challenging period!",2020,Anger,1,0
"I’ve had situations in which I’ve completely destroyed something beyond repair because it wouldn’t work. Growing up, my dad did a lot of stuff like that so I guess I learned the behavior as a normal response. But as I grew older, I noticed in some situations i would just respond that way without thinking about different reactions, I was not being mindful or even trying to control myself. I was thriving in just being angry. A few years ago I just began reflecting really hard and realizing there are certain behaviors that I do not like and I will not do anymore because that’s not going to be who I am. It’s hard to start but once you start controlling your response, being in control more often will get easier and easier. However, no matter how in control I still have that anger, that energy. I use my anger against myself and with all my rage directed at the old me (who would’ve smashed something) I tell myself “im not doing that anymore” and control my actions by either walking away or standing calmly until I can respond productively. Honestly, using my anger against myself to control my actions toward a new direction has been wildly successful. To be clear: I’m not harming myself in anyway, I’m just using my anger to control my actions to spite my old angrier self. I hope this helps. But also, you should consider an anger management program. Best of luck.",2020,Anger,1,0
"This post is a lot so I will try to unpack it a bit. &gt; I finally calmed myself down and did not have an anger attack You did not have an anger attack. That's good. But that also means something was leading up to an anger attack. What led up to the ""almost anger attack""? Whatever got you agitated or frustrated to begin with still has to be addressed. &gt; I’ve done it before but not much. Assuming you mean prevented an anger attack. That's good, you have some successes. We don't learn how to do it overnight. It takes practice. You will still get angry again. We just want to listen to ourselves and continue figuring out how to slow them down and prevent them. &gt; Every time I’ve done it I always feel very very bad after. I feel so depressed and drained Assuming you mean that after preventing an anger attack you feel down. That's normal because you were dealing with something that was making you angry. Its' exhausting having such an emotional swing happen like anger. It's true for people with anxiety and depression too. It can really feel debilitating for a while after. But remember we all get better with time. So we just need to take care of ourselves in the moment and afterward until we recover our senses and start to feel stable and grounded again. &gt; I get like that a lot after I’m mad even if I didn’t manage it. Yes, consider that normal. Difficult, challenging, but normal. &gt; I get depressed then mad or mad then depressed a lot. Yes, this is completely normal. We all come to anger in different ways, from different paths. Depression, anxiety and other things [can lead to anger](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/04/689747637/if-youre-often-angry-or-irritable-you-may-be-depressed). So we need to treat both, or all of them if we know that is what we are dealing with. We can't just treat the anger and not the depression and vice versa. But also, don't let yourself feel like, ""Oh crap, now I have anger too and I have to start all over again."" Anger may be a new thing in terms of what you need to work on directly. But everything you do to help the anger will also help the depression and vice versa. We're a whole, integrated human being. When we work on one thing it helps other areas. So don't beat yourself up about that. If you have trouble dealing with the depression on your own definitely consider a CBT therapist if you can or find some really good resources like the [Feeling Good Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-Plume/dp/0452261740/ref=sr_1_8) by David Burns. Your library may have a copy you can check out for free and there will be other similar books next to it. &gt; I’ve attempted before but hasn’t worked. Won’t do it again I hope at least. Good. We're glad you're here. &gt; I just can’t stop crying. That sounds like depression for sure. &gt; I can’t stop thinking about things I’ve done and people I hurt. That's regret. I can tell you I have some strong regrets, as so many of us on this sub. Anger is one of those things that makes you do really stupid things and when you finally come back down, you realize how dumb and destructive you have been. But that is in the past. We have to leave it there. If we could have done better we would have. But we didn't have the tools we needed to do better. That's half of what anger management is. Learning new tools so we don't automatically go to anger as our way of dealing (or not dealing) with things the right way. And the right way is often just communicating better, both with ourselves, in dealign with our own thoughts and feelings (emotions). And also in communicating better with others, in having more patience, lowering our expectations, allowing other people to make mistakes and be willing to forgive them for it. And also to forgive ourselves. It's hard. It takes practice and persistence. A lot of relationships are ruined by anger. By both men and women of course, we are equally capable of having anger. So just keep working on it. We can't fix what happened in the past but we can work on ourselves now a little bit at a time to try to react and interact better in the future. This [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/c973g8/anger_when_depressed/etb8jrn/) has more detail and practical things you could do. For relationships if I can offer one book it would be [Getting Together and Staying Together](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Together-Staying-Solving-Marriage/dp/006095633X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0).

"Holy shit. My friend in this you are truly not alone. Almost everything you said there I could use up describe the exact situation I am in right now. I just had my first counseling session Wednesday. I can talk if you need someone to talk to that might understand, and another guy on here really helped me by giving me some great advice. Noticing your triggers, and more importantly finding the root of those triggers, is key. The need for control over a situation is something I struggle with also, and I'm being taught to accept that you cannot control everything all the time. In fact,if you try and control your partner, you'll end up stiffeling who they are,and pushing them away. Meditation has been very therapeutic, as well as deep breathing exercises when I feel myself getting agitated. If you feel like you might lose it, have the strength to walk away for a moment. Don't manipulate situations to get your way, it will build resentment. If you love this person, allow her to be herself and have a voice. You may lose her if you dont. I'm finding all of this out at a time, and doing the work, but it may be too late for me to keep the love of my life. Don't make the same mistake, please.",2020,Anger,1,0

"This is a good post for a sub like r/relationship_advice. Forgiveness is key. She didn't know how to be happy herself so she didn't really know how to do things to make you happy as a child either. She says she hates men, but she spent a lot of time trying to find the right one to be her husband and a father figure for you. We all want love and intimacy and to be acknowledged and appreciated by another human being. But things often don't go the way we want. I would caution that you may never find out the true story. The ""truth"" could still be a completely different third story. She told you one story when you were young, another now. The truth may still be hidden. For yourself, I would focus on knowing that you can't change your parents minds. You can't force her to tell you what really happened. So focus on yourself and what you need in life. Forgive her for being human and imperfect and pursuing happiness the only way she knew how. If we knew how to live life better we would all be doing it a better way already. But often we have to learn the hard way because nobody was there to show us a better method when we were young. There are really good relationship books like [Getting Together and Staying Together](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Together-Staying-Solving-Marriage/dp/006095633X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0) that are worth reading to get an idea of how a relationship can work in the best way between two people and how to overcome common obstacles.

"The wiki has excellent general advice, and as fellow sufferers we can offer more specific advice if provided some examples. Something that helps me sometimes: did you know that the human brain is a series of ""simpler"" brains stacked up to the largest portion? (Not an expert, so may have this wrong.) One of the lower portions more or less controls our immediate response to all stimuli. That's the home of our ""fight, flight, or freeze"" response. My therapist introduced me to the reality that anger is not a primary emotion. It is a response to fear or threat. So, if you recognize that anger is a lower brain (I think of it as our internal two year old selves/tyrant) reaction to a stimuli, then you have a chance to get ahead of the reaction and start forming higher brain pathways that bypass the tyrant in response to stimuli.

I developed health problems in 2018 that look like they will permanently change my life, I had a surgery but it didn't fix it. I have been shocked as well to find out that no friends have ever visited me, my family has gone right back to the usual demands of telling me to sort my life out even though now I have a health problem to manage. I foolishly would have believed that there are few situations in this world that would bring friends and family around to support you like being in the hospital or developing health problems. Learned the hard way that people might hardly care. Your gf leaving like that is pretty nasty considering what you are going through. I know it's awful when people act shitty but in a way it's a good thing that they are doing you the favor to let you know who they really are, otherwise you might spend a lot more of your time and energy on that person. Always good to know who is actually an asshole as soon as possible. I hope you won't actually harm yourself. If you are in a situation where there is hope to beat the cancer then I hope you will fight that battle and see if you can get your life back to normal. If people weren't there to support you then you may have some decisions to make in the future about who your friends are and who deserves to be in your life.",2021,depression,1,0
"Hey, I just want to apologise in advance if my comment comes off as insensitive or makes you feel worse - that's not my intention at all. First of all for your girlfriend to leave you like that was awful and you deserve way better than to be treated in that way. It's easier said than done but don't give a person like that too much thought because they aren't worth it and you won't get anything out of it. Secondly, about family and friends not checking up on you a lot - that must feel awful too but the harsh reality is that people are just busy and very preoccupied in their own mind and their own world. But it doesn't mean they love you any less. Nor do they want you to feel unimportant. I'm sure they love you and are always praying for your recovery. I know I'm just an Internet person and my comment probably won't do much, but please, please please don't take your life. I don't think you realise how strong you are and that you absolutely CAN take another year, and many more years. I know it feels like looking through a dark tunnel and seeing no light at the end of it but I promise it's there. Just give yourself a chance. Ending your life kills the chance of things getting better, not worse. You deserve happiness, you deserve good health, you deserve to be respected and loved and all of this will come your way. I, personally, will pray all of this for you. Please hang in there.",2021,depression,1,0
"Jesus Christ man that really, really sucks. But as far as I’m concerned you dodged a bullet with that woman. She’s obviously a sociopathic narcissist. Please do not contact her, YOU should cut all ties because fuck her, you’re better than that. I know all things considered it’s probably very hard to take up that mindset but trust me it needs to happen. If she’s willing to do that to you then no explanation in the world could fix it. I think right now you should try to reach out to your family instead of pushing them away. I did that for many years and now literally the only people I have to talk to are my mom and sister. I love them to death but I kick myself every day for being a shitty, non-available and generally non-reliable family member. In terms of your opiate abuse, I have been thru that as well and it can be a hell of a lot of trouble to kick, so please be careful. Are you good with your siblings, can you talk to them about this stuff? If so go hang out with one of them man, you do not deserve to spend New Years alone. Thanks for sharing your feels with us and I sincerely hope things start looking up. Edit: as another person said I know it must absolutely feel like shit when you have an illness of that severity and you feel like people aren’t checking up on you, but for most people even with very bad illness in the family people just get busy with their lives and assume you’re doing fine. I think this DOUBLY extends to men. People think that all men can just pull through any situation and be stoic, and they don’t believe they need to provide as much emotional support to them. I really hate it, but it’s not their fault, it’s just the way we are encoded. Gah I know that probably does not make one feel better but I just wanted to provide a little different perspective. Please, hang in there op.",2021,depression,1,0

I found that when I was in college (I had flunked out and was only there for one semester), people were a little more accepting and a little more mature.

"Hey! We shouldn't be looking for how to not feel emotions. It sounds like life would be easier and things would go much smoother but emotions are what make us human, and without them we wouldn't be able to feel happiness, relief, peace. Control is what we want. You can start off by acknowledging and identifying what you feel in the moment, then from there ask why. What's making you feel that way? Is it something out of your control? If not, beating yourself up over it won't change anything. If it is, try figuring out what you can do no matter how small. Sometimes emotions feel like like these big scary things that we can't get rid of, they only become bigger and scarier when we let them get to our head too much. Acknowledge them instead of pushing them to one side and suddenly they won't look so big and scary after all.

I beat cancer and know people that have beat some really bad cancers. One even beat pancreatic cancer and has been doing great the past 15 years since and continues to do well. No cancer in sight. And that was after they initially told him he had a year or so. 15 years later and still going strong Another friend beat melanoma stage 3 and some really bad lung cancer after smoking for over 45 years. He passed away from old age at 95 years old with no cancer and he beat it around 30 years prior. The list goes on and on (all true stories). Try to think of the cancer as just a temporary setback that just needs some tlc and a good fight to kick its butt Try to think positive and don't let negative thoughts over run things.

"Exercise can help, as well as a diet change. You can find a way of exercising that works for you, it doesn't have to be intense, it can be simply walking. It can be stuff in the gym, but I'd recommend something that you can do outside, like some simple exercises, running or walking. You can also take up a sport or anything actually, as long as it sounds even a little appealing to you. You can also try to find your own schedule, how many times a week, at what time of the day etc. I walk almost every day for one hour after it gets dark, and it sometimes helps clear my head. As for the diet change, I don't know what you eat, but I've recently cut out the horribly unhealthy stuff I used to eat (excessive sweets and fast food) and it feels good physically, but it also makes me kinda proud. For the record, I don't suffer from depression, but anxiety. I'm not suggesting some weight loss diet, only to try to improve slightly and one by one the things you eat. I'm still in the process of trying to cut out some unhealthy aspects of what I eat and to stabilize a pattern for when I eat. This has been going on for a couple of months now. I think maybe a new hobby could also help. Is there anything you have always wanted to try? Something that seems even remotely interesting? If so, try it out, once for the beginning.

"Hello. I'm going to offer you as clinical an answer as possible. I want you to know that I'm not judging you in any way, and I believe you deserve friends. But I'm from Canada. I don't really know about social customs in Asia. Making friends is a life skill. Judging by your constant moving around, unhealthy home life, mental illness (I promise you I'm not judging, but I will say as a mentally ill person myself it can be incredibly hard to make friends, although I don't think my situation is conparable to yours: I avoid making friends, yet people like me), and maybe some other factors have all contributed to a unnecessary difficulty in making friends. With all that, I believe in you. You want to make friends and you actively go out and try, despite all you're going through. That's amazing, and I know you can do it. I genuinely wonder why you aren't already making friends. It's not like ADHD or anxiety are dealbreakers. Neither is making bad jokes. Overall, socializing is a skill that yoh develop, just like math, or writing, or critical thinking. Like any other skill, it can be greatly improved by practice, and even mastered. It just takes time, and at 16 I think you have all the time in the world. It's never too late. So, some things to start. You're socializing here on Reddit by asking for help. Take it a step further. Practice here. No one knows who you are. Post in active communities. Post in /r/casualconversation . Don't limit it to Reddit. Join a Discord community for sonething you like. Talk as much as you can. Learn social guidelines. Practice your jokes. Find places you can have fun in and enjoy. Conversation is so so much easier when it's about something everyone is passionate about. Go even further. You're in highschool. Highschools have clubs and activities. Join the things you like, but don't force yourself. The point is to be in a stressfree environment with people sharing a common goal or interest. It can be much easier to talk here than with classmates. No judgement, but check your personal hygeine. Make sure you're clean, presentable, and nice smelling. Your clothes don't matter as much as your presentation. It's incredibly hard for people to empathize with mental illness until they have a friend that does, and will try to avoid people that ""look"" ill. You may see dirty crackheads yelling at the sky downtown, wondering how they can be like that. That's how most regular people see people with mental illness. The great thing is, that crackhead can get help, clean clothes, and learn to socialize as well. It's the stigma of the appearance, not necessarily the person. Once you really talk to them, you discover a person with an entire history. The trick is getting people to be open to giving you a chance, and defying this stigma. Check your hygeine, just incase. Your parents are not equipt to deal with your mental illness. I'm sorry. It sucks. My mom was, but worked a lot, my male parent wasn't. Without supports in place, growing up was very hard and led to a lot of bad decisions I wish I could take back. Ask your family for help when you're at your lowest, but don't rely or even expect them to be there for support. I would recommend talking to your guidance counsellor or nurse at school to set you up with a health professional that can help you with your feelings and insecurities, because your family won't. Finally, don't give up. You can do this. I promise you that high school is...stupidish. Hopefully you're getting a good education, but stop caring about those that don't care about you. Find people who do and invest in them. 10 years past highschool and there's not a single person I talk to, best friends included. I don't even remember most of my friends from back then, let alone the people I disliked or barely knew. The people who still give a shit about highschool peaked a long time ago. You will get through all of this regardless with time, but I hope you can practice the social tools you need to find the success you need. Finally, My new years resolution is to stop being a shitty person that keeps sabotaging myself from being happy. Part of that is opening up to people and inviting them into my life. I'm a 28 year old living in Canada just trying to fill my time with more positive experiences. I've grown confortable with being alone all the time but I wouldn't want this life for anyone else and try to help them avoid doing so. I can't be your friend. But I can be a start.

You don’t want to lose your job, years of your life, or make bad decisions if your depression worsens. I don’t want to be negative, but it looks like you’re smart enough to expect the courts and medical professionals to be against your interests. Sorry. I got screwed the same way. Your ex is gonna have control and favor in their eyes unless she screws up. But in the end, our government works against our interests all the time. So just think of it as another form of it. It’s tough but you got to lose the respect you once had for your ex. She wanted to have your child go through this. She’s already messing with you by canceling last minute and using the kid to do it. You got to find people who can listen, care, and provide feedback to you. You’re going to be stuck in legal limbo during all this. You need to realize how much you can get involved in this scenario without getting emotionally drained from it. So you’re in a difficult scenario. Do your best and don’t worry. I’ll let you in on a secret. Religion isn’t some bullshit invented by guys high out of their minds. Despite all the pedophilia and perversion, the Catholic Church is authentic and legit. You just need to find the right people who know what they’re talking about. So think of your scenario as part of the whole general scheme of life then. You’re part of something bigger than yourself. I hope you get better with your depression and you get the control you need in your child’s life.",2021,depression,1,0

"Well you should do a few things. Get friends first off. That’ll help with your life in general. I find it strange you’ve not had any intimate experience, being a girl and all. My sister is the same way though so I guess “what do I know”. If your looks are really a problem for you, you should of course get healthier. We all see overweight people in relationships, so obviously it’s not impossible in that regard. It shouldn’t be a problem if you’re depressed and getting into a relationship, because a relationship (and friends!) can help you out of that potentially. I didn’t have my first kiss/ lose my virginity until I was like 22 or 23. So, I’m a male, and that’s pretty damn late considering the average age to lose your virginity is like 15 or 17 or whatever.

"My depression goes in waves, I'll have good years or bad years, sometimes it changes month to month. I've been fighting it a long time, I also was diagnosed when I was 18. I'm over 40 now. My best advice is find out what works for you to fight it, because depression is a fight, a war even. Even when it feels far away because I'm experiencing a high time I'm still ready to go to war against it at any time. Some people find therapy useful, this is my main coping mechanism. Some people find drugs useful, see a psychiatrist if you want to pursue that path. Some people self medicate and slug through life that way, been there myself over the years, still do to a degree.

"Very same. Very very same. I have to sorta ""create"" problems myself. I feel bad about that too. Like, imagine telling someone that you feel like ending it all just because no one will interact with you and be favorable company on your terms. And others don't even get to eat every day, or have children to take care of and sacrifice so much for... But me, not wanting that sort of life and not having that sort of life, feels like I have nothing to complain about and nothing to be sad about, but I do and I am. I don't want to be me and I don't want to be here. So I look for escapes and distractions. Not always in healthy ways, but I do it because I don't want to feel so bad, so sad, and so frustratingly lonely.

Well I cry at damn near anything so I might not be the best to answer but I'll give it a go. Yes. Empathy is imagining yourself in the same situation as the other person. Some people are just less emotional than others and I think that's normal. If you don't push your feeling aside and avoid dealing with them then I wouldn't worry too much. I never dealt with any emotions when I was younger and am dealing with the fallout now so you don't want to go that route. If it really concerns you there are therapists and such that can help out. They are trained to help you sort out why you feel the way you do even if that's not feeling very much at all.,2021,mentalhealth,1,0

"nothing is wrong with u. First off, mental illnesses can not be wrong or right they are just different mental conditions different people experience. What is wrong tho is how people have treated u when u have the purest of intentions. Iv had similar experiences. Until about 6th/7th grade. They were not my friends tho. Just rlly good manipulators. People that only have pure intentions for everyone, or seem too willing to be ur friend tend to be easily fooled by people who can fake friendship to gain whatever they want. Tbh i wish i could've just stayed alone. it always comes back to that point eventually. But im learning to let go if any judgements i placed on myself due to how iv been treated 90% of my life by 90% of people. and find myself content in solidarity a lot more. Ik it might not be the exact advice u wanna hear right now and even as iv accepted it it still kinda haunts me but id encourage learning to forgive yourself and not associate ur self worth with the misunderstandings of other about who u know u rlly are. Ur kind and caring and friendly. Ur not coming off as fake or artificial to me at least. But i have a lot more compassion than most people these days so i see that shit. Tbh most of society might be to simple minded to see past whatever their brain can make of u and thats no fault of ur own. I can promise u u will find a friend, but if anything is a trait that attracts people to u more (much as its backward logically) its not needing people around u to feel a sense of self worth and love. I honestly just fake it till i make it usually works cuz at first u kinda have to. So if thats the route u choose than try to act like u cant be bothered to socialize unless rlly prompted to. Dont try to talk to people or seem excited to talk to anyone who isn't already showing u the same. Ik this may seem way more fake to u and sadly it is but this world if iv learned anything about it is more full of fakes than not so unless ur ok with not having many friends for most of ur young life its kinda part of it. Also forgot to clarify. I need friends like u not the people i been putting my trust into. So ill be ur friend if u want. Cuz u seem pretty cool fr. Also i have ADHD, Bipolar#2(thought it was depression most of life), and social anxiety as well as generalized anxiety. Tbh i used to resort to drugs because its all iv known to help deal with pain since i was put on adderall than given 100 norco 10s after a bone injury at 12. PLS DO NOT follow in my footsteps. I wish so much i never let my parents put me on meds. Ur way better off just feeling the pain and learning from it.

"Hey, I also have tinnitus and I feared social gatherings for the same reason but there are solutions to this. I, for one, use ear plugs whenever I'm around a lot of people or if I know it's gonna get loud (specifically musician earplugs since they block out noise without making voices sound muffled). Also, you're not pathetic for skipping out on an event, it's completely fine to miss out on a couple. Realize that there will be more chances in the future, after all, a new year is just starting. Not only that but things don't happen immediately which is frustrating, I get it, but instead of focusing on where you want to be, think about the process and little steps you could make to get closer to your goal. That way, it won't feel as overwhelming or out of reach. I'm also young and feel like I've missed out on a lot of things that others my age are experiencing.

"Thank you for the offer. I'm just going to share my story. I was suicidal since moved in with my ex husband. He was very abusive. I thought I was going to finally be free of the abuse of my mom. But I ended up being in a worst situation. I was never happy. Everytime I tried to be appreciated of what my ex did, he would bragged about the things he did that I'm not being grateful or just not knowing what he had in his mind. I finally gave up 2019 and tried to put a gun in my head and ready to shoot myself to end everything, that day also I asked to get a divorce from him. Because I can't stand the bullying anymore. He took my wallet and my phone that night. And I was thinking that I can't contact anyone and I'm alone in this foreign country with no family, very limited friends that know my situation and I'm too embarrassed to share it with some of my friends that I got to know here. That night I ended up to be taken to the hospital to have my mental health stabilize. I have seeing therapist, psychiatrist, and doctor to help me stay sane. We were fighting every single day. He was never there to comfort me. At the end of 2019 early December. I finally said to myself that he said he threatened me with wanting divorce, I will file it myself. Which I did in the end of December. I was all alone by myself. No money, no clothes, and no bed. I'm lucky enough my friends helped me out and they offered me to stay at their fixer upper duplex that I paid with my last paycheck for basically nothing. I finally got an air mattress. Bought a blanket, because it was freezing cold and I don't know how to work the thermostat to stay on the same temperature. I was sleeping in 30 degrees cold for good couple days. My ex finally decided to threw all my stuff outside the house. And friends helped me picked them up from outside of our house. I was so devastated because I don't know why he did that. I think it is pretty cruel to leave all my belongings outside the house in a plastic bag out in the cold. But I picked myself together. And I have been staying in this place for more than a year in 2020. I can say even though I'm so lonely today. And so bored. At least, I'm feeling peace and I'm so much happier than where I was in 2019. I have a good feeling about 2021. I hope my divorce will be finalized and I will be free from him. And I will be happier and in so much healthier mentally and physically than I was years back. I lost 36lbs (16kg) this year. I'm still suicidal from time to time when I have bad days. My dog is always there to lick me and stay by my side to remind me that I have to stay alive for her. Thank you for reading. Happy new year!",2021,mentalhealth,1,0

"So this sounds like me 5 years ago. I destroyed my marriage and drove my kids and most of my friends away. For me it was extreme depression that I didn't want to face. I was so sad and upset that I basically stopped feeling anything else. What got me out of it was meditation and giving my self the space to feel the pain and the permission to feel happiness. I literally had to give myself permission to be happy. My headspace was so messed up I felt like I didn't deserve to be anything but miserable. Today I have a good relationship with my kids and even friends again with my ex wife. I'm not saying any of this will happen to you it just what has happened to me. Meditation really helped me, but I know it's not for everyone. I got really into it for a while before I had my breakthrough but it got me through alot of difficulty. I can only tell you my story and suggest, if you can, try to talk to a professional. Reaching out can be truly difficult, and this is a great first step.",2021,mentalhealth,1,0
"I'll make some assumptions and refer to general cases hoping yours might fall into this category. My advice in this scenario is that we tend to look for reasons that explain why our lives aren't pulled together and our significant others are the closest and easiest receptacle of that blame. People who are down for some reason, or many reasons, often overlook that their significant other is actually going through that with them and suffers with that fact. A different suffering, of course, but still something they wish would go away. So we may think our significant others aren't helping us, or even think they're one of the reasons of our unhappy state, when most of the time that is wrong. It is not easy but if you could evaluate your relationship when everything around is going well, you will get a much clearer and separated vision about it and whatever decision you make will definitely be much more accurate. tldr My work is fine, friends are fine, my family is fine, I am fine as an individual, my relationship is dull? Wait, I may need to fix/end my relationship. My life is a mess, work is crap, issues with friends and family, I am unhappy in general, my relationship is dull?

"I’m so sorry for what happened to you. Its absolutely unfair that you’re having to go through this and it’s not your fault in any way. I’m so glad that you’re still here, that you survived, you are stronger than you know. It’s been 15 years and for me personally, I just in the past two years have been starting to move past what happened to me. I spent over ten years blaming myself for what happened so it was impossible to even try and work thru it. Everyone copes differently and everyone heals in different ways. I can absolutely understand your need to “stalk”. It’s a way to control something that you previously had no control over. Your way of knowing everything that’s going on with HIM, is a way to protect yourself. I’ve coped with trauma and stress/anxiety in similar ways and I’ve also never received mental health care over it. Im sure this is definitely not a healthy way to manage these problems, and it’s going to be really hard to move past this as long as you’re stuck in this cycle of compulsive behaviors. I would really recommend talking to a counselor or doctor about this, but I definitely understand the financial burden that would bring on. That’s a big reason why I haven’t been able to deep dive into therapy yet. (I have a lot of other problems and traumas and just don’t have the financial or mental capacity to deal with it yet). Aside from all of that, regarding this POS’s new girlfriend: it is not your responsibility to protect someone else. Your main priority needs to be yourself. While that is true, from a woman to another woman, I would also feel obligated. The intrusive thoughts of “what if” would personally cause me a lot of internal turmoil. If you’re going to do something I would recommend it being absolutely 100% anonymous. Do not put yourself in any possible danger. If you can’t do this without him knowing it was you I would recommend you don’t. I would probably make a throwaway social media page and DM her the warning. Keep it vague, don’t be too direct about it or a “he will definitely hurt you stay away from him”, she may react to that defensively. I think it would be better received as a “please be careful, watch out for red flags, don’t let your guard down, being in a position of physical vulnerability may trigger his predatory mindset etc etc”. Even if she doesn’t respond or even believe you, it’s the act of you TRYING that would matter. Once you do it, wait a few days and if she doesn’t respond just delete the account. Block him from all of your social media accounts. Delete any photos in your camera roll that trigger flashbacks or reminds you of things associated with him. Cut out as much about HIM as you can. You need to focus on yourself. You are the most important person, your life and your mental health ARE the most important and valuable part of existence. Anything that makes you think otherwise (people, belongings, music, food etc) should be cut out and replaced with things that add emotional value and feelings of wellbeing. I would recommend having someone act as a type of “sponsor” for if/when you start having intrusive thoughts again. When you start thinking or obsessing about what he’s doing or who he’s with, you will contact this “sponsor” and they will talk you down from the stalking actions. They can just be a friend or someone online. They just need to remind you that this POS doesn’t matter and you have no room in your day to let this person live rent free in your thoughts. His life doesn’t matter. He is nothing. YOUR time is valuable and what YOU are doing is important. Anyways, that’s just my take on it. Again, I’m so sorry for what you went thru and for your ongoing struggles. All of your feelings and actions are absolutely valid. If you think the sponsor idea is worth a try, and if you don’t have anyone to act as one or there’s no one you feel comfortable with, I’d be happy to. ____",2021,mentalhealth,1,0

I'm no expert on the matter and have done little research to back up my opinion but I believe that medications help you to form habits, moods and thoughts that are sustainable and not depreciating, I believe that once the habits, moods and thoughts are in place you can begin weening off because you have a new way of thinking made possible by medication.

Social anxiety and low self esteem will make you believe people don’t like you and it’s usually far from the case. I know how hard it is to think it’s not your fault.

"One of the challenges of medication in treatment mental health conditions is that it offers symptomatic treatment. Antidepressants improves mood (a symptom), while anxiolytics reduce anxiety/reduce heart palpitations etc. (also symptoms). Medication alone often might not, and do not target the root of the issue, which might be a result of the interaction between a person's biological, psychological, and social environment. Unless active steps are taken to intervene at the root of the issue, psychotropic medication might have to be taken for a longer term than they should. Having said the above, it is very possible to reduce consumption/dosage and eventually stop taking medication for the majority of mental health conditions with the appropriate treatment plan, which might include psychotherapy in conjunction with medication.

"Can I just advice you this... Don't mistake your internal state of being for lack of love towards your husband. There is no distinct ""feeling"" of love. Love is simply the recognition that your husband is there for you, that you two are a team. If you are in a happy state of mind already, this recognition may put a smile on your face, and cause you to feel even more happy seeing him. But if there is no happiness inside you, this recognition may seem meaningless, and that empty feeling may be projected onto your husband, by subconsciously blaming him for failing to cause happiness to arise in you. But I would advice you to be careful in tying that to not ""feeling love"" for your husband. It is not your husband's job to cause happiness to arise in you, this is very important to realize. Because you have tied it down to being related to your husband already, it might be very difficult to discuss this with him. But I think it might be very beneficial and maybe even essential to include him in what you are going through. Love is not just there when you are both happy. Love is supporting each other during rough patches too. Maybe you can include a professional therapist in this process, but I think it might already be very healing if you simply tell your husband that you are feeling so empty inside. Just be careful not to turn him into the root cause of your suffering, but simply acknowledge and talk about the suffering itself. If he indeed loves you, then he can help you heal.",2021,mentalhealth,1,0

"1. You need space and time away from your ex. 2. All I see is negativity in your post. Start practicing gratefulness: begin by listing at least a minimum of 5 reasons/things you’re grateful for. Write those down daily on a piece of paper. Follow thru for atleast 30 days. 3. Meditate. This is easier than it sounds. Beginning by closing your eyes. Box breathe. (Breathe in 4 seconds. Hold 4 seconds. Breathe out 4 seconds. Hold 4 seconds. Repeat.) while doing this, focus 100% on the breathing. On the air entering, exiting your lungs. The cool air leaving your nostrils and touching your upper lip. Your spine relaxing. If you start thinking of other things, it’s fine. Just calmly bring your mind back to the breathing. This will also increase your focus and help with the impulsiveness. 4. You need to learn to love your self. Develop your self esteem. How? Stand infront of the mirror and tell yourself you love yourself. Identify what you love. If you don’t feel those feelings of admiration and love, fake it till you make it. Do this daily. 5. Finally, make sure you’re taking care of your body’s physical needs. Start focusing on what you’re eating, hours you’re sleeping, exercise. 6. Addictions. Reduce coffee, alcohol, sex, nicotine, &amp; masturbation. Identify other physical addictions. Reduce immediately. Start focusing on bettering your self. You take care of your mother, now start taking care of yourself.

"I'm so sorry that you're going through this. I cannot replace a professional therapist or a close relationship, but maybe I can give some of my own methods of dealing with repressed thoughts and emotions. I agree with the other comment saying repressed memories are a safety mechanism of your mind when things are happening that you are not yet cognitively capable of dealing with. It's not easy to relive those memories, but also keep in mind that they are memories. They are not you. You are now in a safe environment, reliving those memories. It can be very strengthening to recognize that distinction between the you who is observing the memories, and the you who is in the memory. We tend to build a story that describes ourselves based on our memories. But don't forget that the you who is going through memories is here and now, and not in the memory itself. You can provide the comfort, love, and support to your former self that is feeling all the pain in that memory. It may help you to try a meditation practice to help you cultivate this separation between memories and the here and now. There is no one step solution for dealing with trauma. It is something that slowly but surely you must process. I wish you the strength and courage to get through this.",2021,mentalhealth,1,0

With the right mindset, you can filter out a lot of selfish or outright bad people.

"OK, first of all, let me begin by saying I am completely sympathetic to what's happening to you. You are suffering and that's not good. But let me offer a tangent here that might help you through this. Sometimes, a repressed memory isn't really a memory at all but a construction that is trying to tell you something else. That is, your memories might not be real but are red flags attempting to get you to examine your life more deeply. You've said that your mom gaslights you about things, so you're definitely being psychologically / emotionally abused by her. I don't know the content of these suddenly surfaced repressed memories, but if they are connected to family, a family friend, or in some way to someone who is associated with your mom, then the memories may be indictments of the person in the memory for failing to protect you or advocate for you. I say this not to try to say I'm denying your claim, but to help you understand that what you're currently experiencing in your mind and in your life are intertwined with the emotional abuse your mother is inflicting on you when she doesn't listen to and believe you. That's why you really need to see a therapist; a therapist can help you sort out your feelings and get a handle on what's really happening with your memories. I, too, had repressed memories of abuse. I believed my father had abused me for years. However, once I began to work with a therapist, it became evident that I wasn't being abused by my dad but that I held him responsible for not protecting me from the physical and emotional abuse inflicted on me by my mother. I held her blameless and accused him because, as a child, I labored to appease her--that's common among abuse victims, by the way--and so transferred a lot of the anger and hate I felt toward her onto my father. When I was finally able to begin creating a timeline of events in my life, it became evident that my father never abused me at all and that what I thought of as ""spankings"" and/or ""lectures"" were actually beatings, gaslightings, and baseless paranoid accusations that all stemmed from my mother's own undiagnosed and untreated mental illness. So, three things: First, don't cling to your repressed memories as factual recollections. Memory is reconstructive, meaning we build our memories every time we evoke them; we don't recall, we rebuild with what's available. Accept that they are signs of trauma, but don't place too much faith in them that they are factual--they may be, but they may not be. That's the real problem here. Second, talk to a school counselor. They are legitimate counselors and can help. They will get you in a stable place until you are ready to find your own therapist. Third, if you don't already have a part-time job, get one and start saving money so that you can move out. You need to get away from your mother because she gaslights you. That constant gaslighting isn't healthy for you and will only serve to color your memories with false images the longer you stay in her presence. Good luck!",2021,mentalhealth,1,0
"I sometimes write every single thing I feel when I’m upset in a journal and feel a bit relieved after because there are many things going through my head which I can’t really openly tell my friends.

"I completely understand your concern. Sometimes it's a vicious cycle where we have no control over our anger, and this is often followed by guilt for reacting the way we did. Let me remind you, all emotions including anger are a natural, healthy part of the human experience. As a therapist, I understand that anger can be a very overwhelming response and can often take up a lot of our time. It's okay to dwell on your thoughts, but, more importantly, we have to try to remember to take a step back when experiencing an emotion like that of anger. To ask ourselves and to understand the emotions underlying our rage, before we react. Here are a couple of tools to help manage your anger before it takes over you: 1. Becoming aware of when you're getting angry- this alone could help you regain some amount of control over the feeling. 2. [Mindful breathing](https://youngmenshealthsite.org/guides/deep-breathing-exercises/): 3. Some of us have a greater tendency to replay in our heads, over and over, the incident that is bothering us. Try to focus on the present, and move past what happened. 4. By [trying to replace unhelpful negative thoughts with more positive ones](https://www.healthline.com/health/cognitive-restructuring#gathering-evidence). Reflect instead of reacting. For instance, ""my temper is ruining my life.” Instead think, ""I'm going to try to control my temper better next time."" Please feel free to reach out to me for more help or support.

"Definitely seek therapy as soon as you can. If you're planning to seek higher education after high school, there should be some available counseling services anywhere you'd go.

It has been hard for me, but reading about others' experiences helps. For me, this is helpful because I find myself in deep empathy with the victim and I try to transfer what I think about the victim (and their ultimate blamelessness, or innocence) to myself.

It's not that I don't like them, I'm just too wound-up around them.

It could possibly be getting worse because subconsciously you’re expecting it to happen. Nausea and diarrhea are the most common symptoms of anxiety and stress and if you have social anxiety it’s plausible it’s related to that or perhaps you’ve ignited a generalised anxiety over feeling nauseous and vomiting.

"WreckItBaymax, your post really struck me as it seems to describe me accurately: I have social anxiety due to past causes, but it has taken on a life of its own where I now am believing untrue or exaggerated negative things about myself. How do I start the process of breaking the cycle? Every tiny social interaction I have sends me into a cycle of negative self-talk ('I am a monster. I am bad. I am unlovable.') I have been working on that self-talk, but I really struggle when I have an interaction and it triggers me, sending me into a spiral. So what are some concrete steps I can take with that trigger hits... how can I tease things apart so that I am not constantly reinforcing those untrue and exaggerated thoughts?

"Dear Social Anxiety, You have been my protector and my safety for as long as I can remember. Almost like a lucky rabbit foot, you are there to make sure I don't screw up.

I am unlovable. People will always leave me.

The pain you give me, Anxiety, is intense, but it is never as terrible as the pain that I would if I were caught unawares by someone abandoning me. The problem is, Anxiety, is that you are so hungry. A little self-loathing and isolation is never enough. I have to keep hating myself more. I isolate more and more with each day. The pain of my own mind is crushing me. I want to be free from you like an abused woman wants to escape her violent husband. I want to with all my heart, but where would I be without you?

"I did it for a month. It was amazing, I'm going to do it again. The best part was removing myself from negativity and expectations.

I found myself automatically picking up my phone and scrolling for the apps (I deleted but did not deactivate accounts) but I kept reddit :) The reason I went back on was because I noticed I was missing too much. Social media is massive and I realised I had been missing important and fun things too. I felt out of the loop and I started to feel isolated. So I rejoined, but it taught me a lot and I don't go on social media anywhere near as much as I used to. I also unfollowed/deleted a lot of unhealthy or unnecessary crap. It's 100% worth a social media detox, it helped a lot with my mental health and self esteem, but I don't think I will ever deactivate long term as I tend to feel too isolated, which just fuels my social anxiety and depression.

I’m 42 and for me a lot of the biggest improvements in addressing my anger have been to first work on noticing when I get angry and then to figure out what made me angry. Neither of these have been easy for me. Realizing I’m mad has helped me take the first step of disengaging before I hurt someone (or myself). I mainly do this by noticing physical triggers like tightness in my chest, crossing my arms or even a strong desire to keep talking. The second part, figuring out what made me upset, has been really healing. This is often for me either deeply personal (such as connecting to the trauma of losing my mother) or just a unmet expectation (like looking forward to a few minutes of quiet to read or do work when my kids come and interrupt me). When I understand why I got upset, it has really helped me let go of it.

"As someone who has dealt with this, there is usually something underlying that has me on edge, making the minor mishaps push me over the edge i'm already standing on. For me, I had a ton of childhood trauma and undiagnosed PTSD that I didn't even realize was there. That's just an example. But I was really fucking pissed and hurt about this huge thing but it was so repressed that, for a long time, my only symptom was anger, and snapping at small things. I definitely go into fight/flight and feel this super intense need to express my anger physically, otherwise i'll like fucking explode and die or break down or i don't even know, I just feel like the only way for me to survive in that moment is to break something. You're gonna hate this but the only thing that was a relatively easy fix was antidepressants. You find the right one, and take a dose small enough NOT to blunt your emotions a ton, it levels you out. That, and obviously therapy, learning when to retreat to a different space and activity and take a timeout. Anger is like ostracized so much in present culture but it's a vital and powerful and natural emotion. It's all about what you do with that anger, though. When i'm super pissed off, I go to the batting cage or the driving range, or even buy some cheap stuff from a thrift store to smash (safely). Another thing that helped me is giving things a story. Like someone is driving super slowly in front of me. I tell myself the dude is 80 and give him some imaginary life story to distract me from my anger. Another thing is grounding yourself, which sounds stupid. I usually need something to ""shock"" my body and give me something else to focus on. I stick my face in a bucket of ice water, I eat those warhead candies, when I don't have anything else I'll put some hot sauce on my tongue and be a baby about it. Big thing is just leaving the environment and talking yourself down or distracting yourself. I usually go outside and look around and just try to breathe. &amp;#x200B; I don't know if any of that helped but yeah, you did mention being annoyed by spending time with your family, so maybe there is something or someone there causing this underlying anger.",2021,Anger,1,0

This overall has resulted in me drafting a two sentence text over the course of 3 hours and me spending an extra hour gathering the courage to send the text itself.

"It sounds like you have a lot of expectations of the world. No one gets through a day with nothing going wrong, or at best they're very rare. People get through by not expecting or even hoping for perfection, and expecting that they're going to have to roll with a few things. It's not like other people don't have glitchy games or laggy internet or other people to have to accomodate, they just have a different attitude about it - they expect it, and they work with it. They wake up expecting that some things will go wrong, and challenge themselves to find ways to make it work or find an alternative. Something I've done that's helped with attitude it to focus on gratitude. Think of 5 things you're grateful for, once when you wake up and again some time during the day when you're not feeling your best. Think of a couple things that you accomplished or went right for you before you go to bed, and appreciate that. It sounds kind of dumb and might be hard at first, but it gets easier &amp; I bet if you do it for a couple weeks you'll find your attitude changing, your anger fading at least a bit and you'll have more energy since you're not wasting so much on being mad all the time.

We over think things like how we look, what we said or just what others think of us, and its mostly the negatives we notice, we think of the worst possible scenario in a situation.

"That's not really how they work. They are intended to work as a crutch to help you ease the physical symptoms of anxiety and numb the anxious thinking just enough so you can go through therapy. And then keep helping to keep them at managable levels. If you believe taking pills will cure your social anxiety you will end up disappointed. You have to learn new patterns of thinking, antidepressants won't change any of that.",2021,socialanxiety,0,1

"Doc offered Fluoxentine for social anxiety. I refused and did CBT with Exposure Therapy instead, and I'm more or less out of the woods now. Like you, I simply didn't want to take antidepressants. They can help you reclaim some of your life back though, taking them while you work on your anxiety issues might work for you. Being able to see non family members or visit local places can really boost your self esteem and give you motivation to beat the rest of it. They take a few weeks to get to work, but the best advice is to speak to your GP, speak candidly about how you feel about them. Personally I would not recommend solely relying on them, it's not a way out. Nobody can tell you what path to take, but it's important that you try one and get to work. Small wins are huge wins with SA and it's time for you to start feeling good about this stuff again.",2021,socialanxiety,1,0
"I tried many SSRIs and did not have much success. I also had bad side effects with some, and weight gain. I felt fogged all the time. You would need to check with a doctor to see what the most current recommendation is on this. SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. This med works by holding onto and thereby increasing the serotonin neurotransmitter in the brain. It was believed that people with social anxiety disorder had too little serotonin. But recent studies indicate that the opposite is true, that we have too much serotonin, see [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150617115327.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150617115327.htm) The more serotonin we produce in the amygdala portion of the brain, the more anxious we are in social situations. In the above article it says: 'Serotonin can increase anxiety and not decrease it as was previously often assumed', says Andreas Frick. Benzos can help in the short term if allowed by your doctor, The best road might be Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which teaches you to gradually get used to and improve in social situations. I had a terrible problem when I was young and am much better now, after having tried everything. Best of luck!",2021,socialanxiety,1,0

"I agree with this to an extent. A sure fire way to increase your self-esteem is to feel like you are developing in life and contributing to society or helping others in some way. I would encourage everybody to work hard and always strive to better themselves. However, we must never fall into the trap of associating our self-worth with a particular endeavour, because then we’re constantly playing the comparison game. Feeling either superior or inferior to other people based on our perceived level of performance in life. Judgement is a double-edged sword. We might feel like we’re better than those ‘losers’ over there, but as soon as we encounter somebody ‘better’ than us our guard instantly goes up and we experience massive anxiety. You said it yourself. Even when you reach that long-term goal, you are not satisfied. Your mind instantly sets the bar higher and demands even more of you. This is human nature. The rat race of life which few of us can hope to ever escape. Ultimately, no matter what anxiety tries to convince us, we all deserve love and acceptance just for being here. None of us chose to be born after all. We all have different upbringings and socioeconomic backgrounds, we all possess unique strengths and limitations and we all experience inner struggles. Essentially, we are all just scrambling around doing the best we can with the resources we have in this moment, trying to find some meaning and fulfilment in life. We should cut ourselves some slack and be a bit kinder to ourselves. Being nicer to ourselves does not mean that we are giving up on ourselves. I think we all possess an innate desire for self-improvement. The difference is that the motivation is purer because our self-worth is not wrapped up in our endeavours. When you are genuinely nicer to yourself, you are nicer to other people. And you get back what you give out. If only this was as easy to put into practise though!",2021,socialanxiety,1,0

"Seems like you've been abused and neglected for having emotional reactions. Your parents beating you to get you to stop crying is not right. You were a child and needed to be soothed, and empathized with. You needed to be validated and understood. If you want to heal from all of this please read below. In order to have a fulfilling life and fulfilling connected relationships you have to work on your emotional side. You cannot have passion for life or anything if you're emotions are suppressed and hidden away. This can lead to depression and is often a symptom of emotional neglect... ##what is emotional neglect? A majority of parents just want what's best for their children, but some are abusive and neglectful in many more ways in addition to *emotional neglect*. It is invisible and thus often overlooked in favor of treating physical abuse /neglect (understandably so). ^(I won't focus on this kind of abuse in this post because there's plenty of literature and understanding on trauma) It is certainly present in abusive homes but also can be present in homes where everything *looks* good. For example parents are financially well-off, nice home, provide great nutrition, the best clothes, the best academic education, and the best head start financially, never spanked, hit, or witnessed domestic violence... So it's easy to assume people brought up like that had a ""perfect"" life. However it is quite common that parents (whether with bad intentions or good intentions) are ill equipped to handle and support their child emotionally. CPS won't spot these issues and can't really do anything about it because there's no physical scars or malnutrition to document. ##Examples of Emotional neglect - Told to stay out of sight when you're upset /crying - Rarely hugged /cuddled. - Told you we're too emotional/dramatic. - Always cheered up with money (new toy, new clothes etc) - Told as a child that your problems didn't matter because your parent had SO much more going on than you. - Being punished for having emotional reactions. (Your favorite toy broke /got lost, you're sad, parents tell you to stop crying or you'll get a time out etc) - If you weren't happy and all smiles your parents would not want you around. There's many more examples but this really gives you a good idea. These things might seem trivial or 'not a big deal' and isolated occurrences aren't a big deal. However, if this is how you're brought up... Day in day out as a child over time you're taught that your emotions are to be suppressed, hidden. You're taught that you're emotions make you unreasonable and wrong. Slowly self esteem is chipped away and you might only feel proud when you get that new promotion or when you buy a new house. But the feeling doesn't last. #Symptoms of Emotional neglect - Low self confidence - sometimes a seemingly little thing can set your anger off - when something bothers you, you don't say anything you'd rather avoid uncomfortable situations - depression - anxiety - afraid that if you open up people will leave you. - poor ability to maintain or develop habits - you often work until you burn out - you have difficulty resting, being kind to yourself And more. Needing nurture, emotional support and unconditional love is part of being human and if that eas missing it affects you deeply. Fortunately, you can heal from this. You can learn how to open up and pick up healthy habits. You can feel fulfilled and at peace with who you are. You can be happy. This won't solve all your problems but recovering from this will make your financial problems, relationship problems, etc feel like you can tackle them without burning out. ##Here's a few resources that might help you. - [*Running On Empty*](https://drjonicewebb.com/the-book/) by Jonice Webb (and its sequel) Amazing books that really help dig deep, gives you easy do's and don'ts for developing healthy coping skills, healthy habits.

The reason I HIGHLY recommend these is because they focus on emotional *neglect* which is often (and understandably) overlooked in favor of more visible issues such as physical /emotional abuse.

I've struggled with anger too including punching through walls breaking chairs. I get the red. Therapy definitely helps to uncover what might be triggering you.

I yell and stuff and I always end up regretting it. I'm not sure why or what triggers your outbursts, but maybe it's something to do with your thoughts. Do you feel isolated (internally)?

"Oh I know the feeling of being afraid of your own anger. I haven’t gotten the best hold on it but here is some advice for now: Until you have a better hold of it, recognize your trigger points and try and just remove yourself from the situation before reacting. Don’t even give an explanation, just remove yourself and take a walk or a breather or anything. Just remove yourself from the situation when possible. This is something that you should do for a bit until you have better control of your anger. It’s also good because you’ll have a better chance to reflect on exactly what it is that triggers that anger. Sure it’s your sister asking for help, but exactly what about it makes you angry and frustrated? Another huge help for me was getting into meditation. So often just stopping and recognizing that you are angry is enough. It’s good to have a better understanding of your emotions and let them be there but without taking you over. If you’ve never meditated before, try one of the free apps or find help on YouTube. I personally love Headspace but there are other options out there that are free. Maybe give headspace the free trial and see how you like it. Finally if your anger scares you and you think you might hurt someone, get professional help. I have had explosive anger issues since I was a kid and I had some therapy to deal with it. As a kid it seemed kind of stupid but looking back now it helped a lot growing up, but unfortunately not enough. Talk to someone and maybe join an anger management group. Anger management is not a bunch of middle aged men who drink a lot or whatever stereotypes people have. It’s a very diverse group of all kinds of people (in my experience it was all men). Anger is a real issue that I think people need to talk about more. It’s awesome that you recognize that there are issues and that you are worried about hurting someone. Don’t forget that your thoughts are just thoughts and they do not define you. I hope this helps a bit. Good luck!",2021,Anger,1,0

Don't get a little better and then quit therapy. Keep going until you are confident and feel great about how you are living. Anger is called a secondary emotion because other emotions fuel it.

Keep in mind, this is advice from a complete random stranger so take it as you see fit to your situation. I think it's time to step out of your comfort zone and have a talk with your dad about the things you're struggling with and that you're fearful of destroying a relationship that could be healthy. Don't let your ego get in the way of that.

From what you described, your parents seems like they would understand and would be open helping you seek out the help you need. Don't ever rule out therapy as an option. Don't let your ego get in the way of that as it's okay to get help. You're at a great place right now, which is admitting to yourself that you're part of a problem that you can fix. Don't stop now - change starts with that revelation and you'll feel so much better about yourself, your relationships and your outlook/perspective on those around you!

"I have been the same way most my life too. In therapy, I've recently started to understand CPTSD and emotional neglect as the reason my anger manifests. My father had a terrible temper, I witnessed and was victim to it growing up. When you're small and you absorb this kind of behaviour, it becomes hardwired into your basic survival skills. You're not just an angry person, your behaviour is likely a result of environmental conditioning when you were small. Does that sound familiar? For me it feels like a natural reaction that I have zero control over. I've personally had to accept that this behaviour really is a part of who I am, but I have the ability to recognise it, along with recognising my triggers. Feeling shame is natural but punishing myself cruelly isn't going to help me learn and grow. It only compounds it deeper. Just recently I've figured out that I need to walk away and be in a quiet room alone when I l've lost my temper with my partner. We could be in the middle of a discussion that's getting more and more heated and I can see it's not going to help my temper. So I've forewarned my partner that I sometimes need to walk away, to take a breath. At first this frustrated him, but now he can see it is preventing me from saying or doing things I'll regret. Quiet space works well for me, you just need to find what might help you in a similar situation. I'm not sure if any of this is helpful, but I wanted to let you know you're not alone. Admitting to your behaviour and actively recognising it is a huge step many never take. You have the upper hand on it now you know it's there.",2021,Anger,1,0

"&gt; but sometimes I feel like they would be happier if I wasn’t in the picture. Do not allow yourself to keep believing this negative thought. If you can't fix it on your own please find someone to talk to about it, whether it's a CBT or family therapist. Couple's therapy is worth the effort too. And it's not just to beat you up about your problems and your anger. It's to figure how how to have a working vision of how you want your relationship to be. Anger is often a communication problem. Not feeling acknowledged or appreciated. And it goes both ways. He could be feeling his anger because of communication frustrations. Anger is called a secondary emotion because other seemingly less important feelings fuel the fire. So if you can make those frustrations, annoyances, resentments better, the anger will get better too. Throwing things is a clear sign of anger and is a huge trigger for people who have been in abusive relationships. So getting the throwing under control is very important, not just for the cost of the phones but for the impact it has emotionally on your kids. If you can help yourself learn how to process your feelings better it will help the entire family in the long run. If you have time to read one book on relationships this year please make it [Getting Together and Staying Together](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Together-Staying-Solving-Marriage/dp/006095633X) You feel remorse and regret after getting angry. That is completely natural. We have high standards for ourselves and when we do something that doesn't live up to them we can be disappointed in ourselves. But if we can learn how to work with that cycle better we can benefit from it. Don't get mad or upset with yourself for getting mad or upset. It only makes it last longer. Treat each anger episode as an incident you can review to help figure out at what point you could have intervened with yourself to have a better outcome next time. Try to look at your angry reaction as a poor set of default techniques for handling your emotions that you have picked up over time or simply learned as a child and no one was able to help correct that approach. Learning anger management is the effort of picking up new techniques that work better for yourself and everyone involved. You could start by journaling not just anger but also [anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201404/how-keep-thought-diary-combat-anxiety) and taking an [online course](https://mentalhealth.openpathcollective.org/account/anger-management/) in anger management. If it's not enough in the time frame you would like to improve, seek a therapist. Don't be embarrassed. We all need help at some point in our lives. That's why there are counselors, therapists, life coaches, pastoral counselors, you name it. Sometimes we just need a little guidance on how to improve. It takes a lot of courage to admit you need help. And a lot of humility to be willing to say I am doing things wrong and could be treating the people I love a lot better and I want to learn how to do that. Be extremely kind to yourself while going through tis learning process. Beating yourself up about it every step of the way is counter-productive. Save your time and energy for learning new things. When you find yourself feeling embarrassed, regretting and resenting, that's part of it. Say, ""Oh that's what I'm doing, I'm regretting right now!"" And that's ok! It's great to consciously recognize it. But don't let yourself wallow in it. Say, ""I have these classes and new approaches I am focusing on. I don't want to get slowed down by regret. I want to keep learning."" We all struggle with this. It's a daily battle for some, an occasional concern for others. But we all have to deal with it at our own unique levels.

"For me, it was digging deep in myself and understanding my source of anger, in my case it was fear. Anger is an emotion that we depend on when we run away from other certain feelings, I had a dozen of anger issues to the point of passing out and having seizures out of pure anger. I found out that when I get emotional in a way, I resort to anger because it’s the only feeling that’s familiar and is comfortable and easy to let out. I realized I always dose my words with spites of anger constantly. I was afraid my whole life, and it comes out as anger to mask the fear, I broke down and shed tears for years and years of abuse at home, school, and work. It’s all built up pain from various experiences that was never processed and I drastically changed as to my fiancé’s word, she says at some points she can’t even believe me now and me a year ago were the same person.

If you can recognize that you’re angry and think for a couple seconds before acting, you can prevent yourself from doing hurtful things. You’re old enough where any time you hurt someone else, there are going to be consequences for you also, as you’ve seen. Perhaps someone with more experience, especially with teens, could comment. Many people start with keeping a journal of anger. What happened? How did you feel? How did you react? In retrospect, was it worth getting angry over? One helpful technique for me was to write an anger scale from 1 to 10, You can assign a word to each level, with 10 being “infuriating” [someone tried to kill you] and 1 being “mild discomfort” [Someone looked at you funny in the grocery store] or whatever each number means to you. Once it’s done, look back on things you’ve gotten angry at. Was each incident as bad as it felt at the time? Was the action you took and the words you said worth what you might lose? It’s great that you recognize you don’t want to hurt your relationship with your mom. This is Big Apology time. Not sure where you are, but in the US, she could have you arrested. Tell her what you told us, that you feel terrible and don’t want to harm her, or your relationship with her. Do you think your parents would be willing to get you help in working on this issue?",2021,Anger,1,0
"I feel this on a pretty deep level my friend. But I find mine stems from things like why don't people at work do something this way or why can't people be thorough because it's so often asked of you but seems like hardly anyone does it themselves. I'm almost 30 and have had anger issues throughout my life. Its hard to say how they came to be but I don't use the, oh im an aries that's just me. I notice people I can be friends with for sometime I start to view differently and in my head wonder why do they do this or that? I know I'm not perfect myself but I always find myself getting so angry about things and I can see it happen. My main worry is I don't want it to become between my girlfriend and I in the long run because I know it's not fun to be around. But I also have sympathy for other people who are like that because you can usually tell when it's to be genuine or when people are wanting to be assholes. I'm with you on that struggle and I haven't figured it out myself either but just as long as you are taking steps in the right direction that's all we can do and promise to always work on it and be mindful!

I have a similar situation when my cat like forces himself into my pillows at night and I kind of push him and my girlfriend brings up how i handle it and then I definitely feel bad about it. Like you said anger is definitely an emotion and I dislike when people just aren't real about their emotions because I know everyone gets mad. Some more than others but people's brains are like computers and some people's aren't wired quite the same and different emotions can be harder to control than others.

"When you ask a group like this, who already know they want help with anger for example, they are going to already be open to seeing a therapist and talking about mental health to begin with. So you are going to skew towards the ""Yes"" answer. So just focus on what you need right now. If you think you need a therapist then do that. If you think you need an anger management class or a trigger diary, so that. But don't self-diagnose yourself with what you have read online. That can be just as bad a mistake as not doing anything about it at all. You don't want to diagnose yourself with IED, ptsd or bipolar, etc. See a professional for those kinds of considerations. The problem with diagnosing ourselves is we can convince ourselves, ""Oh well I have IED so there's nothing I can do."" When the truth is basic anger management skills can help even in the hardest cases. We just have to be willing to want to change and to investigate where our anger is coming from. And remember a diagnosis doesn't mean you're doomed or destined to be that way. Especially in the US, a diagnosis is for insurance companies. So you can get the help you need. But you, we, are all sophisticated human beings. No one diagnosis can describe our experience. We all need a little help in different ways at different stages of our lives.

"Have you ever read much about ADHD? In the course of my own diagnosis and research, I've always been really taken by this realization that, for many of us, our dopamine circuitry is fucked. And that circuitry is paramount to....literally moving a limb. Getting your body to do something. And so when you have a poorly functioning system like that, your body seeks out SOMETHING, Anything! to get the dopamine it needs to motivate your body to actually move. For many people it's food, nicotine, etc, but I really, really think for other people it can be: a constant sense of crisis brought on by conflict, or, being competitive, or, maybe the rage feeling? I don't know. These are just my first thoughts, but I think if you're able to feel for yourself how that feeling is giving your body what it needs to get work done, then you're in a pretty great place to keep learning more and see if you can figure out the connection. Plus, with ADHD, your executive function skills are crappola. This also means you have practically zero emotional regulation skills.

"No answers here, just suggestions. Number 1: Be kind to yourself. In other words give yourself a break! It's ok to get angry and to feel upset. The key here is perspective. I think you know this. You say it yourself - if I let it go I feel fragile, if I have the lat word I am egotistical. Really ask yourself: Does having the last word really change anything for you? Are you really fragile if you don't have the last word? The truth (which I think you know) is neither are true- you're just angry. You need to be able to let go. Let go of your anger and your perception of what is right or wrong way to react. The problem with anger is that it is a reaction to a threat or an injustice. The key to stop reacting is to accept different perspectives, points of view and even your own anger not as something wrong to defend or be fixed, but as a part of life - there will always be some guy on the Internet, there will always be something wrong or something to put right. Step 1 is empowering yourself to stop asking yourself the world and other people to conform to the way you want to be and to allow there to be assholes, to allow yourself to be angry and also to allow yourself to not have the last word and let your anger go It's hard - I'm on the journey myself.

"Anger is a strong feeling for the want of change. When you say you look at the people, politics, your life situation and you feel angry, you are feeling a strong desire to change things, to take action. Anger is a motivator, if used correctly, it is an internal impulse to make a change. It's like thinking ""the politics of US is so messed up, why is it like that, it should be different, I want it to be different!"" and then you feel the desire to change it, which is anger. In your case it seems like you have built up a lot of anger and it has turned into hatred for life. It does not make you a bad person, I personally think angry people are very determined and strong-willed people, if they can use their anger as motivation to improve things. Anger can also burn you and damage your life and relationships though, as it seems to have done in your case. You should try to find a way to express your anger. Sports, art, anything that comes naturally to you. You can only change your own life, unfortunately you can't change other people or the state of US politics. It's good that you feel the emotion to want to change everything, means that you want to take action, but you're better off directing that determination into changing your own life.",2021,Anger,1,0

"&gt; I also hit myself really hard. I hit my legs because that’s the part of my body that can endure the best a blow. I hit over and over again until the pain feels like a relieving sensation This provides temporary relief, but it is actually not helping you. You are training your body and mind to think that there are appropriate times to release anger. That can easily lead to you physically venting your anger in a way you regret later - imagine losing control and beating a sibling or parent, without even really making the decision to. Living with anger issues is best done through practicing mental techniques to keep yourself from going over the edge. Going over specific situations in your mind before they occur and rehearsing calming down during them. Some people work on counting to ten whenever they feel their blood start boiling. There are lots of different ways to work on it, but finding ways to let it out or vent is not going to help you in the long run. Also hurting yourself is never a good thing. I know it feels relieving; of course it does! You let off some anger, your body released some seratonin to cope with the minor pain, your blood is flowing to your brain better, helping you feel calmer. But it's really unhealthy. Even if you don't progress to hurting yourself further and further, you can cause damage to your legs over time. Like a rock that gets smoothed down gradually by the ocean, you could be causing serious problems to your legs that don't appear until years from now. These things are why I see a therapist and why I take medications. Maybe you don't need meds, but better to see what a professional thinks before dismissing it. And maybe you don't need a therapist long term. But the right one can provide some mindfulness techniques and other practices so you can keep yourself from wanting to destroy things.",2021,Anger,1,0

Anger is like an iceberg. It's the top part you can see. Underneath the surface there are emotions causing the anger. If/when you feel able possibly with the support of a therapist/professional you may want to explore/work through those emotions and understand your anger. The last thing I'd say is that there is a whole process to grief and it sounds like you are grieving. Give yourself time and compassion to process this. Losing a parent is a major life event.,2021,Anger,0,1
"I think it’s natural to have mixed emotions about a parent passing away, especially if they wronged you in some way or were abusive. I think allowing yourself to feel whatever emotions you have is healthy. Don’t bottle it up or deny it. There is no wrong way to grieve. In time, your emotions will fade and you’ll hopefully be more at peace. I’ve heard some people recommend writing about it, or doing a sort of symbolic letting go ceremony. The right sort of music has helped me a lot during hard times in life. If you can, you might consider seeing a councilor or therapist to discuss your feelings and get validation that what you’re feeling is normal. Maybe you need to forgive him for something he did or maybe you need to forgive yourself. A good therapist can help you figure it out.",2021,Anger,1,0

"Sometimes when I have a difficult emotion I'm having a hard time letting go of, I give it to a book. I write it down in as much detail as I need to, and let the book hold it for me. If the thoughts come up and I don't need them, I remind myself the book is holding that right now. The permission to not hold on to something that is hurting me if freeing. When I'm ready to process I can read or add to the book if I want, &amp; when/if I'm ready to let them go I can burn it or toss it. it's ok to keep it, too, whatever works for you - the idea is to create some distance to allow yourself a chance to heal, and live your life without being constantly contaminated by it.",2021,Anger,1,0

"It’s ok to have feelings. To be angry, sad, or anything in between are natural human reactions. Sometimes these emotions can be hard to control and can go too far one way or the other. The key to handling these emotions is to realize you’re having them and processing them in a healthy way. I hope whatever it is that’s eating at you either let’s up or you find a way to heal yourself from taking your negative feelings too far. I don’t have all your answers and not one single thing can fix life’s problems but I assure you I know you’re here as well as everyone else reading this.",2021,Anger,0,1

This is not normal, and I’m sorry to tell you that while it may be easy for you to forget after, anyone who witnesses it will not forget so easily. It will be held against you in the future. Today it may have been the wall/furniture/whatever, but one day you WILL hurt someone you care about. Please get help. Your life will be so much better because of it.

"I find that anger is usually a reaction to not being heard or understood in a situation. When someone pisses you off, make a habit of asking them “do you know how that makes me feel?”. If it’s a parent, who is likely to just brush you off and either say you’re out of line or pretend that they do, repeat “do you know how that makes me feel?”. If they ever say yes, then counter with “explain. Explain how you know!” It puts them in a spot to either explain that they understand why you’re angry and if they can’t, and hopefully say something like “well tell me then” at that point you can explain all of the reasons why you’re angry in the moment that aren’t immediately obvious. You know what I mean? I’m also not expecting this all to be done in a calm voice, just try not to yell. Good luck.",2021,Anger,1,0
"After much therapy I have one of two approaches. Walk away. Completely out of the room. Go.find something else to do for an hour. No words, just walk away. Second approach if you have emotional energy ""When you do xx, it makes me feel yy"". So so so key in this situation to say a FEELING. Don't do ""When you say 'wow, you're eating again', that makes me like you think I'm a fat cow."". If you say ""like"" you are not doing it right. Instead you say ""when you say 'wow you're eating again??', it hurts my feelings and makes me feel ashamed."". There is something sosososo magic about expressing your feelings.

Fish tanks gave good advice. I agree with the life being better part. Therapy seems scary at first especially when you don't know what to expect but it really helps. Just having that person to talk to about things that others wouldn't understand is so comforting. Therapists are trained for this kinda stuff and they are good at it. Some schools offer them for free and some clinics do too if you are under 18. But if you aren't I still recommend you see a therapist or a doctor at a clinic that will help you get one. I hope that they help you understand whats going on! Take care &lt;3,2021,Anger,1,0
"It sounds cheesy and cliche but find what is a constant contributor to your anger. I feel like a lot of people are angry at the world or life for not turning out how they planned. As a result they have this built up anger and frustration towards life and the world that they cant unleash because they don’t have a physical being to yell at and attack. You can sit there and scream at “life” because it’s not going as planned, but you’ll just be sitting there screaming into the air and getting no response or reaction. Now you’re holding onto a lot of anger and frustration and, even if it’s subconsciously, you’re looking for someone to take it out on. This is why you suddenly go off on people you normally wouldn’t, like friends and family. You know you can take it out on them and most likely face little to no consequences. The short temper develops over years of holding stuff in. It’s like a cup of water, only so much water (anger) can be held in the glass (you) until it spills over. Find what is making you upset. Do some deep thinking and searching. You’re not going to like the answers you find and might even realize you hate who you’ve been. Take full responsibility of anything lingering in the back of your head and accept things that have happened so you can get rid of any old anger and sadness. Cry if you need to. You probably will. Once you get to the root of everything you don’t like about yourself and start changing those things, you’ll be a lot happier, less anxious/sad which leads to less anger. Consider people who have hurt you or done you wrong in the past. See if you can forgive them and reconnect or if you can even forgive them at all. We hold onto a lot of negativity and consume it everyday through entertainment and news. You have to let some of that go.",2021,Anger,1,0
